We describe a 48-year-old Caucasian woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by the onset of word finding difficulties, effortful speech along with prosody distortion, in the context of spared semantic and syntactic abilities. The clinical picture, perceived as foreign accent syndrome (FAS), was not associated with structural and functional imaging changes or neurophysiological assessment abnormalities. We suggest that FAS, herein perceived as a regional accent syndrome, should be considered a possible additional neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList

Underinsured patients and ethnic minorities exhibit significantly higher mortality rates, while limited access to care (further distances to hospitals and rural residences) is linked to inferior outcomes <xref rid=\"b1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"b6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[6]</xref>. Delays in treatment initiation, in part driven by missed appointments or decreased patient health literacy, preferentially affects underserved populations <xref rid=\"b4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref>. As the regionalization of care continues to evolve and patients must travel longer distances for complex oncological treatment, these trends and discrepancies may intensify <xref rid=\"b7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[7]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[8]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>With an emphasis placed on survivorship in head and neck cancer care, the financial and psychological burdens associated with treatment and surveillance may go overlooked. Both direct and indirect costs of complex oncological care can be immense, including transportation, lodging, and personal and caregiver time off work <xref rid=\"b9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[9]</xref>. Unique to head and neck cancer, disease and treatment may result in unconcealable deformities and dysfunction. It stands to reason that underserved populations may be disproportionately impacted from both economic and emotional perspectives <xref rid=\"b10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[10]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[11]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>Located in an urban city where an estimated 40% of the population lives in poverty, our academic tertiary-care institution serves a large demographic of socioeconomically challenged patients. To better serve this unique population, we aimed to identify barriers of care amongst patients with advanced head and neck cancer. This report quantifies underrecognized challenges with transportation faced by such patients. Concurrently, we share a personal correspondence received from a patient in our practice to highlight the rigors of public transportation during one\\'s treatment phase. An enhanced understanding of these social determinants will provide practitioners with insight to address the current discrepancies in head and neck cancer care.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\" id=\"s2\">\\n      <label>2.</label>\\n      <title>Materials and methods</title>\\n      <p>Following approval from our Institutional Review Board (#19&#x2013;063EX), we reviewed the electronic records of in-state patients from our institution\\'s multidisciplinary Head and Neck Tumor Board Registry database whose insurance coverage was either &#x201C;Medicaid,&#x201D; &#x201C;Medicare,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Uninsured&#x201D; from January 2015 to December 2017. Patients with either supplemental insurance or ambiguous coverage were excluded in order to best capture the underserved population. Patients whose treatment recommendation was not curative in nature were excluded. Patients who received adjunct treatment at an outside institution were excluded. From this cohort, 50 patients were randomly selected using a random number generating software. Retrospectively reviewing physician, nurse navigator, social work, and demographic documentation, the following information was extracted and recorded into a single dataset: age; gender; race/ethnicity; marital status (married, single, divorced, or widowed); smoking and alcohol usage (current, previous, never); primary tumor location and type; TNM classification; date and location of diagnosis (our institution versus outside institution); treatment modalities; incidence of treatment toxicity; home address; location of scheduled treatment and clinic visits; transportation utilized to get to and from appointments (when information was available); the incidence of missed treatment or surgical, medical oncology, and radiation oncology surveillance appointments within one-year post-diagnosis; the reason given for a missed appointment (when available); the incidence and date of recurrence; and the date of the last known follow-up.</p>\\n      <p>All data collection and analysis were completed using our institution\\'s secure institutional network. The number of missed treatment visits was inconsistently captured in the electronic medical record and was extrapolated from physician and nurse navigator notes in select cases. Thus, the incidence of missed treatment or surveillance appointments were calculated as dichotomous endpoints. The method of transportation utilized was not available for every appointment. To reduce heterogeneity for statistical analysis purposes, the following categories were used: public, caregiver, and professional (i.e., medical transportation, taxi service, ride sharing applications). Google Maps software (Google LLC. Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to determine the physical distance between patients\\' home addresses and our institution. Multiple transportation routes were calculated for each scenario: via public transportation using Google Maps software (the route with the shortest travel time), and via digital ride-hailing options using the Lyft and Uber mobile applications (Lyft, Inc. San Francisco, CA, USA; Uber Technologies, Inc. San Francisco, CA, USA). The cost associated for each option was calculated and recorded, excluding routine costs such as vehicle maintenance, tolls, and gasoline. All routes were calculated under the assumption of optimal travel and traffic conditions, and did not account for variability based on demand.</p>\\n      <p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for the study cohort and baseline associations between variables were calculated using Pearson Chi-square and Man-Whitney U testing. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the associations between continuous or categorical variables and endpoints of interest. The primary endpoints of interest were the incidence of missed treatment and surveillance visits. Secondary endpoints were the incidence of disease recurrence. Odds ratio (OR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated via Wald Chi-square and Fishers exact testing. Box-Tidwell procedure was used to confirm the linear relationship between continuous variables (age, distance) and the logit transformation of the binary outcomes. Multivariate factorial binominal logistic regression analysis was executed, but found to be statistically insignificant likely restricted by the sample size. Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized to estimate recurrence-free survival, and log-rank test was used to assess differences by groups. Patients were censored accordingly at the date of last assessment, loss to follow up, or death. Cox proportional regression methodology was used to analyze recurrence-free survival by various patient, disease, and treatment factors. P &lt; 0.05 using 95% confidence intervals was considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics Software, Version 27.0. Armonk, NY, USA).</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec id=\"s3\">\\n      <label>3.</label>\\n      <title>Results</title>\\n      <p>The median age of the study cohort was 61 years old (range, 46&#x2013;92). Thirty-one (62%) patients were male. Thirty-three (66%) patients identified as &#x201C;White/Non-Hispanic,&#x201D; 13 (26%) as &#x201C;African American,&#x201D; eight (16%) as &#x201C;Latino-Hispanic,&#x201D; three (6%) as &#x201C;Asian,&#x201D; and three as &#x201C;Other/Deferred.&#x201D; Fourteen (28%) patients were married, 19 (38%) were single or never married, 11 (22%) were divorced, and six (12%) were widowed. Twenty (40%) patients identified as current everyday smokers at the time of treatment initiation, 19 (38%) as previous smokers, and 11 (22%) as never smokers. Fifteen (30%) patients reported current daily alcohol use, 13 (26%) as previous daily alcohol consumers, and 22 (44%) as never-drinkers.</p>\\n      <p>Laryngeal cancer was the most common primary site (n = 24), followed by the oral cavity (n = 18), oropharynx (n = 7), and sinonasal region (n = 1). Squamous cell carcinoma attributed for 47 (94%) of the neoplasms. Two patients had adenoid cystic carcinomas, and one had adenocarcinoma. Based on AJCC 7th edition, 36% of patients had T4 classified lesions upon presentation (n = 18), and 44% of patients had N2 disease (n = 22). Forty-two (84%) patients underwent surgical extirpative procedures. Forty-eight (96%) patients underwent radiation treatment, 38 (76%) of which were adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy was included in twenty treatment regimens (14 adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation, six primary chemoradiation). Eleven (22%) patients experienced treatment-related toxicity, all of which were CTCAE Grade 2 or less. Patient, disease, and treatment characteristics are summarized in <xref rid=\"publichealth-11-04-058-t01\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 1</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>The median distance from home address to our institution was 19.9 miles (range: 0.8&#x2013;72.8 miles). Nineteen (38%) patients lived within the same state county as our institution, 19 lived within bordering counties, and 12 (24%) were from nonbordering counties. Sixty-eight percent of cases (n = 34) were diagnosed at our institution. Visual representation of the geographical region in relation to the patient cohort are illustrated in <xref rid=\"publichealth-11-04-058-g001\" ref-type=\"fig\">Figure 1</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>Dependability on caregiver transportation was reported by 42% (n = 21) during the first year of treatment. Thirty-two percent of patients (n = 16) reported using public transportation. Public transportation options were not available for eight patients. Thirty-five patients (70%) utilized a method of professional transportation (i.e., medical transportation) during the first year. The use of a personal ride-sharing application was noted in four (8%) of the patient\\'s records.</p>\\n      <p>For the 16 patients who used public transportation, the median shortest travel time was 52 minutes (range: 16&#x2013;232 minutes). Eight (50%) of these routes did not require a transfer, four (25%) routes required at least one transfer, three (19%) required two transfers, and one required three transfers. The public transportation routes required a median of 0.7 miles of walking (range: 0.27&#x2013;1.4), estimated to take a median of 16 minutes (range: 4&#x2013;30 minutes).</p>\\n      <p>Patients who were divorced were 5.8 times more likely to utilize public transportation compared to those who were not (p = 0.016, OR 5.83, CI 1.4&#x2013;24.5). Widowed patients were 1.4 times more likely to utilize family transportation compared to non-widowed patients (p = 0.003, OR 1.40, CI 1.1&#x2013;1.8). There were no differences between the type of transportation utilized and patient race/ethnicity, age, alcohol and tobacco use, and tumor staging. There was no association between the distance (continuous and categorical) from our institution and the type of transportation used.</p>\\n      <p>A total of 20 (40%) patients missed either or both a surveillance or treatment appointment in this first year. Nineteen patients (38%) missed surveillance appointments, and 12 (24%) missed treatment visits. Transportation was listed as a reason for a missed appointment in 45% of the patient\\'s charts (n = 9). Family tragedy was captured as a reason for a missed appointment in one case. Information about reason for missed appointments was not available for the remainder of cases.</p>\\n      <p>Those patients who used public transportation were 3.3 and 4.6 times more likely to miss treatment and surveillance visits, respectively, compared to those who did not (p = 0.001, CI 2.8&#x2013;8.7; p = 0.014, CI 1.3&#x2013;16.4). The use of caregiver and professional transportation were not significantly associated with missed appointments. Current tobacco usage was associated with increased odds of missed treatment (p = 0.035, OR 4.33, CI 1.1&#x2013;17.3) and surveillance appointments (p = 0.043, OR 3.36, CI 1.02&#x2013;11.1). Inversely, those who never used tobacco were 1.4 and 8.3 times less likely to miss a treatment or surveillance visit compared to those who used tobacco (p = 0.032, OR 0.71, CI 0.58&#x2013;0.87; p = 0.025, OR 0.12, CI 0.01&#x2013;0.93, respectively). Similar trends were seen with current (OR 3.22) and never (OR 0.49) alcohol usage and missed treatment visits. Neither distance or diagnosis at an outside institution was associated with the incidence of missed visits. Gender, race/ethnicity, age, marital status, primary site, staging, and treatment toxicity did not predict for missed appointments.

    <p>The median length of follow up was 992 days (range: 79&#x2013;2284 days). Sixteen (32%) patients experienced locoregional recurrence or treatment failure. The median time to recurrence was 403 days (range: 25&#x2013;1607). Both missed treatment and missed surveillance appointments within the first year were associated with the incidence of recurrence (p = 0.003, OR 1.40, CI 1.1&#x2013;1.8; p = 0.003, OR 1.40, CI 1.1&#x2013;1.8, respectively). All other factors, including TNM classification and distance, were not statistically associated with recurrence.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec id=\"s4\">\\n      <label>4.</label>\\n      <title>Discussion</title>\\n      <p>The findings in this single-center cohort demonstrate that underserved patients undergoing multidisciplinary head and neck cancer treatment face a variety of obstacles related to transportation. Moreover, these results suggest that transportation barriers may hold significant clinical implications. By identifying high-risk demographic and geospatial predictors, this review aims to improve our current understanding of limitations to ideal oncologic care and clarify relationships between travel, access, and outcomes.</p>\\n      <p>Prior literature assessing national cancer databases has associated increased travel distances with improved outcomes in head and neck cancer care <xref rid=\"b12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[12]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"b14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[14]</xref>. Initially thought to reflect patients traveling further to seek higher quality of care, Massa et al. alternatively proposed that travel distance is a surrogate measure of patent factors and socioeconomic resources. Their group hypothesized that this survival benefit is likely the effect of unmeasured confounding, as patients with the resources to voluntarily travel further may have other protective advantages <xref rid=\"b13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[13]</xref>. Exclusively selecting for a disenfranchised cohort, we observed that 40% of such patients missed appointments in the first year of treatment regardless of travel distance. Rather than distance itself, challenges with travel like dependence on public transportation were linked to missed appointments and worse outcomes. Additional investigations at the patient-specific level, like that of our cohort, are needed to better clarify these relationships.</p>\\n      <p>This report highlights the necessity to further allocate institutional resources to assistance programs focusing on ancillary patient needs. Providers are tasked with imparting effective transportation services to vulnerable patients undergoing complex oncologic care. Similar to many tertiary care institutions, our organization has team members dedicated to facilitating care, providing available resources, and navigating such issues. Medicaid has developed state-specific programs to provide eligible beneficiaries with non-emergency medical transportation <xref rid=\"b15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[15]</xref>. Nonetheless, these factors may go overlooked as evident by our own review, let alone by institutions without dedicated resources or experience caring for socioeconomically challenged populations.</p>\\n      <p>In complement to traditional medical transportation, the digital transportation network companies Lyft and Uber offer an alternative option. However, the cost associated with such services can be immense and not feasible for underserved patients. Only four patients from our cohort reported their use. To demonstrate the financial burden of these services, the median one-way cost of using a private, digital ride-hailing method of transportation was $44.53 (range: $7.80&#x2013;$179.67). The median one-way cost of using a shared, digital ride-hailing option was $37.36 (range: $6.81&#x2013;$152.75). To counter such costs, both companies have backed initiatives to fulfill third-party, health care-related ride requests. These services are named Concierge and Circulation, respectively <xref rid=\"b16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[16]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[17]</xref>. However, their applicability to underprivileged populations and certain regions may be limited by smartphone accessibility and driver penetration to rural areas <xref rid=\"b18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[18]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>As efforts to reform the delivery of care proceed, it is essential that we utilize patients as a valuable resource and barometer to measure change. The following passage was written by a patient in a personal correspondence with our team when discussing the transportation options available:</p>\\n      <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">My &#x201C;Highway to Healing&#x201D; began in February of 2017 when I was diagnosed with advanced tongue cancer. My treatment consisted of a triad of medical, surgical, and radiation specialists who carried me through seven weeks and 35 daily visits for chemotherapy and radiation treatments. In the proceeding twenty months, I would take nearly 50, 2-hour bus rides from Atlantic City, NJ to Camden, NJ, then back home. Each trip was fraught with frustration, anxiety, and anticipation. What news would I receive? How would I feel after treatment? What would the person next to me think about my trach? Or portable suction? This journey and these emotions eventually became routine through diagnosis, treatment, and after</italic>.</p>\\n      <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">I am grateful to all for the exceptional care I have received from my teams and their staff. However, my passage to recovery and remission may have been considerably easier, faster, and more convenient without the physical, psychological, and economic obstacles faced... Simplifying the process would have significantly lessened many of the hardships I endured as it actually took place</italic>.</p>\\n      <p>When focusing on treatment outcomes and survival, it is easy to overlook the subtle nuances mentioned above; the prolonged uncertainty of receiving unsettling news and having to cope with bad news in a public setting. These elements may be intensified and specific to head and neck cancer due to the burden of specialized equipment like suctioning devices or the cosmetic deformities resulting from disease or treatment. These logistical and psychological considerations faced by head and neck cancer survivors are unique and may be more prominent in those of underserved populations relying on public transportation. When asked how to make visits easier and less stressful, Massa et al. found that head and neck cancer patients desire both the reduction of transportation difficulties and frequency of clinic visits <xref rid=\"b19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[19]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>As proposed by Graboyes et al., the model in which we delivery care should serve as a modifiable target for changing head and neck cancer outcomes <xref rid=\"b12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[12]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[20]</xref>. Within the last decade, the multidisciplinary clinic (MDC) model of care has been introduced at select institutions, in which surgical, medical, and radiation oncology appointments are streamlined into a single day. Initial studies analyzing head and neck cancer MDCs have reported improved access to multimodal therapy <xref rid=\"b21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[21]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"b24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[24]</xref>. However, no studies no date have demonstrated their applicability in underserved communities, although the theoretical benefits of this care model seem ideal.</p>\\n      <p>Liao et al. demonstrated that treatment delays and worse outcomes in urban patients are most commonly due to missed appointments and treatment refusal <xref rid=\"b4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref>. Our review demonstrated that missed appointments was associated with disease recurrence. By limiting the number of appointments, and reducing the burden of transportation, the MDC model may lessen missed appointments in underserved patients. In a similar vein, lower socioeconomic status is linked to a worse level of medical literacy <xref rid=\"b25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[25]</xref>. In the MDC model of care, perspectives from various ancillary providers including speech language pathology, audiology, and nutritionists may provide patients with additional information and help to address the underlying motives for treatment refusal.</p>\\n      <p>Our cohort may reflect a marginalized population, potentially influenced by the effects of the marginalization-related diminished returns theory <xref rid=\"b26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[26]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[27]</xref>. This concept explores the reduced efficacies of various interventions amongst marginalized people, due to broader societal processes such as racism and stratification. Despite improving factors such as access, worse than expected outcomes may still be observed amongst some of our subgroups.</p>\\n      <p>There are several limitations to this report and discussion. This was a single center analysis restricted by the retrospective nature of data collection and small sample size. Future multi-center prospective studies are warranted to more consistently and quantitatively capture patient perspectives. Inherent to the statistical analyses, certain associations may not maintain significance with more robust cohorts. Moreover, the variables assessed are often not mutually exclusive. There is likely a high level of multicollinearity amongst various socioeconomic factors and critical interactions between each predictor. To correct for this, we attempted to conduct multivariate factorial analysis; however, the results were limited by the sample size. Larger population-based analysis is required to uncover the true effect and associations these factors hold. Numerous factors, including education, income, and psychological outcomes, were not included due to the retrospective nature of data collection. These aspects of patient-centered care serve as targets of interest for future studies. Finally, prospective studies applying the MDC model in underserved populations need to be conducted. Since health literacy and socioeconomic status are closely related, foreseeable limitations exist (i.e., patient understanding or retention may decrease as more information is given in a single-day multi-provider visit).</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec id=\"s5\">\\n      <label>5.</label>\\n      <title>Conclusions</title>\\n      <p>Head and neck cancer patients have to balance numerous surgical, medical, and radiation oncology appointments over the course of their treatment, which can be practically and financially challenging. The analysis presented herein highlights the underrecognized magnitude of transportation challenges faced by patients of an underserved population and the clinical implications they hold. Practitioners should continue to explore changes to policy and delivery of care in an effort to best advocate for their patients.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec id=\"s6\">\\n      <title>Use of AI tools

To address these challenges, it is crucial to prioritize interventions that promote personal recovery and address the unique needs of this group. When developing effective, equitable, and relevant interventions, it is essential to consider the experiences of persons with an SMI. By incorporating their perspectives, we can enhance the understanding, and thereby, the design and implementation of activity- and recovery-oriented interventions that promote health, quality of life, and social connectedness in this vulnerable population. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the stories of participants partaking in Everyday Life Rehabilitation and how they make sense of their engagements in everyday life activities and their recovery processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Applying a narrative analysis, this study explores the stories of seven individuals with an SMI residing in Swedish supported housing facilities, participating in the Everyday Life Rehabilitation (ELR) program during six months, and how they retrospectively make meaning of their engagement in everyday life activities and recovery processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>The participants\\' stories about their rehabilitation and personal recovery pathways elucidate how the inherent power of the activity, as well as the support the participants received to get started and succeed, had a significant impact on their self-identity, confidence, motivation, mattering, life prospects, and vitality. The participants valued the transparent steps along the process, weekly meetings, the signals, beliefs, and feedback communicated throughout, and the persistent, adaptive, and yet supporting approach in their personal progress.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>This study underscores the need for interventions that prioritize meaningful activities and are sensitive to the complexity of the personal recovery process, especially in supported housing facilities.

In September 2015, the United Nations (UN) recognized the impact of mental illness on the overall well-being, economic development, and social progress by including mental health as a priority in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <xref rid=\"b2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[2]</xref>. This was a significant step, as it marked a global commitment to tackle mental health challenges involving all societal sectors, including governments, the private sector, community organizations, and the individuals themselves <xref rid=\"b3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[3]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>Accordingly, mental illness is a global public health problem with significant consequences for individuals and society. Serious mental illnesses (SMIs) result in enormous economic costs, with even more significant implications for economic growth than for the healthcare system <xref rid=\"b4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[5]</xref>. A significant fraction of years lived with disability (YLDs) <xref rid=\"b6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[6]</xref> are caused by SMIs. People with an SMI often experience limitations such as poorer engagement in healthy activity patterns, including meaningful community involvement, low work capacity <xref rid=\"b7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[7]</xref>, self-care, sleep issues <xref rid=\"b8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[8]</xref>, stigma and discrimination <xref rid=\"b9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[9]</xref>, loneliness, isolation <xref rid=\"b10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[10]</xref>, and fear <xref rid=\"b11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[11]</xref>. Consequently, individuals suffering from SMIs have their life expectancy reduced by 10 to 20 years due to a sedentary lifestyle and preventable physical diseases <xref rid=\"b12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[12]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[13]</xref>, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular ailments <xref rid=\"b4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>Many SMIs can be effectively tackled, reducing individual suffering and economic costs <xref rid=\"b14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[14]</xref>. People with SMIs need to be provided with comprehensive care that includes a range of health services and interventions. These should include pharmacological therapies, rehabilitation, and social support programs that enable personal recovery, meaningful activities, and social participation <xref rid=\"b15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[15]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"b17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[17]</xref>. Nevertheless, effective treatments and rehabilitation are often hampered by underfunded health systems, a lack of qualified professionals, a lack of collaboration <xref rid=\"b18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[18]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[19]</xref>, low status <xref rid=\"b20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[20]</xref>, stigma, and an inefficient use of health resources <xref rid=\"b4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>In recent decades, many mental health services and social support programs in most developed countries have adopted a personal recovery-oriented approach <xref rid=\"b17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[17]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[21]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"b23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[23]</xref>; moreover, some interventions, most of which focus on training staff, such as REFOCUS <xref rid=\"b24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[24]</xref> and CARe <xref rid=\"b25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[25]</xref>, have personal recovery as the core focus. However, in Sweden, most organizations still need to implement a personal recovery paradigm <xref rid=\"b26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[26]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"b28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>&#x201C;Personal recovery&#x201D; is described as a deeply personal, unique process of changing one\\'s attitudes, values, feelings, goals, and skills and/or roles <xref rid=\"b23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[23]</xref>, claiming that living a hopeful, fulfilling life, and participating in society, are still possible despite having a mental health condition <xref rid=\"b29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[29]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[30]</xref>. The acronym &#x201C;CHIME&#x201D; provides the five main contributing components in the process of personal recovery: connectedness, hope, identity, meaning, and empowerment <xref rid=\"b31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[31]</xref>. A personal recovery approach recognizes the significance of engaging in meaningful occupations as a pathway to well-being and recovery <xref rid=\"b32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[32]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[33]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>Individuals with an SMI living in supported housing facilities typically have a long-term and complex disability that requires ongoing support to manage their everyday life <xref rid=\"b34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[34]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[35]</xref>. However, living in supported housing facilities may further reduce self-determination, autonomy, motivation, and meaningful activities <xref rid=\"b36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[36]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b37\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[37]</xref>. In addition, collaboration between health and social care staff has been noted as a challenge <xref rid=\"b19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[19]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[26]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[36]</xref>, and the housing staff (HS) often presents poor levels of competence and lack belief in rehabilitation <xref rid=\"b19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[19]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[36]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[38]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[39]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>People with SMIs often face stigmatization, discrimination, lack of access to resources <xref rid=\"b20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[20]</xref>, and limited opportunities <xref rid=\"b26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[26]</xref>. A movement known as &#x201C;occupational justice&#x201D;, which is rooted in the broader social justice movement <xref rid=\"b40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[40]</xref> and seeks to address issues of inequity and oppression in society <xref rid=\"b41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[41]</xref>, has pointed out these disparities. According to occupational justice, all individuals have a right to engage in diverse and meaningful occupations that promote their health and well-being <xref rid=\"b42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[42]</xref>. As occupational beings, humans have a natural inclination to be active, to engage in activities that enable them to create meaning in their lives, to develop and express their identities, and to provide a sense of accomplishment and belonging within their communities.</p>\\n      <p>However, vulnerable populations, including persons with SMIs that reside in supported housing facilities, are particularly susceptible to experiencing occupational deprivation. &#x201C;Occupational deprivation&#x201D; refers to a lack of opportunities or barriers that prevent individuals from engaging in meaningful activities <xref rid=\"b41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[41]</xref>. It recognizes the impact of external forces&#x2014;such as social, cultural, structural/organizational, economic, and political factors&#x2014;on an individual\\'s ability to participate in meaningful activities <xref rid=\"b41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[41]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[43]</xref>. The consequences of occupational deprivation may include poor health <xref rid=\"b15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[15]</xref>, capacity atrophy, and social exclusion <xref rid=\"b41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[41]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>Since people with SMIs who live in supported housing facilities often lead a sedentary life with a downward spiral of motivation, hope, meaning, and personal agency, and generally have low health literacy, they seldom actively seek rehabilitation themselves. In Sweden, basic healthcare, including rehabilitation, is mandatory for municipalities, which must offer basic healthcare to residents in sheltered or supported housing facilities <xref rid=\"b39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[39]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[44]</xref>. However, some municipalities lack rehabilitation, and in others, support for residents is insufficient <xref rid=\"b45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[45]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>Therefore, the Everyday Life Rehabilitation (ELR) program <xref rid=\"b36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[36]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[46]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"b48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[48]</xref> was developed to address the unique challenges of long-term housing facilities. ELR consists of web-based education for the HS and OTs, tools for collaboration, and methods targeted to the residents\\' personal recovery through enrichening activities and participation. ELR underlines occupational justice and equity regarding access to outreach, integrated, person-centered, long-term, and timed activity-based and recovery-oriented rehabilitation, promoting a meaningful everyday life, personal recovery, and an increased quality of life <xref rid=\"b48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[48]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>In order to develop and refine relevant interventions, it is important to include the perspectives of the intended participants. Drawing on the experiences of persons with SMIs who have recently participated in the ELR, this study aims to give them a voice. Interpreting and illuminating their narratives permits their voices to be heard and recognized, empowering them to be active agents and promoting their inclusion in discussions related to their recovery processes <xref rid=\"b49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[49]</xref>. Narrative analysis is a valuable method to understand the sense-making of intricate ways in which the recovery process unfolds through the activities and experiences of everyday life <xref rid=\"b50\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[50]</xref>. Using this approach, the researcher can identify the key events and meaning-making within each participant\\'s story, which can help further clarify the meanings and interpretations they attach to their experiences <xref rid=\"b51\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[51]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>Narrative analysis <xref rid=\"b52\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[52]</xref> offers a means to explore and illuminate the stories of individuals with SMIs living in supported housing. It allows them to express their experiences, perspectives, and insights <xref rid=\"b52\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[52]</xref>, which are often marginalized or overlooked <xref rid=\"b20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[20]</xref>. Narrative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between activities, personal experiences, and the broader context in which recovery occurs <xref rid=\"b50\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[50]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[33]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>Adopting a health equity perspective, this study highlights the need for interventions that address occupational deprivation and provide individuals with SMIs living in supported housing facilities equitable opportunities to engage in meaningful activities <xref rid=\"b53\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[53]</xref>. Consequently, this study seeks to contribute to the body of knowledge that informs the development of more person-centered, activity- and recovery-oriented approaches that address the unique needs and preferences of individuals with SMIs residing in supported housing facilities, promoting a healthy and meaningful everyday life, personal recovery, social connectedness, and quality of life.</p>\\n      <p>The aim of this study is to explore the stories of participants partaking in ELR and how they make sense of their engagement in everyday life activities and their recovery process.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec sec-type=\"methods\" id=\"s2\">\\n      <label>2.</label>\\n      <title>Methods</title>\\n      <p>This study applied a narrative analysis <xref rid=\"b52\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[52]</xref> based on the participant\\'s stories. The narrative analysis approach was considered suitable as a means for the participants to reflect upon, make sense of, and communicate the meanings they attributed to participating in ELR and meaningful activities in relation to their recovery process.</p>\\n      <p>Through a narrative analysis, the researchers collect detailed descriptions of the events, actions, and experiences as the primary source of data <xref rid=\"b52\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[52]</xref>. The basis of the narrative inquiry is the idea that individuals create meaning by narrating their stories. Additionally, the collaborative aspect of narrative research allows for interactions between the researcher and participants, enabling them to co-create knowledge, as meaning-making occurs in a collaborative process <xref rid=\"b54\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[54]</xref>.</p>\\n      <sec id=\"s2.1\">\\n        <label>2.1.</label>\\n        <title>Overall context</title>\\n        <p>Complex mental health-supported housing accommodation services in Sweden are based on a needs assessment and are mainly regulated by the &#x201C;Social Services Act&#x201D; <xref rid=\"b55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[55]</xref> to ensure a reasonable standard of living, or the &#x201C;Act Concerning Support and Service for People with Certain Functional Impairments&#x201D; <xref rid=\"b56\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[56]</xref> to ensure good living conditions for people with extensive and persistent disabilities, including integrated basic healthcare and rehabilitation, according to the Healthcare Act <xref rid=\"b44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[44]</xref>.</p>\\n        <p>In Sweden, there is a considerable variation in the praxis of supported accommodations, particularly regarding offers of integrated rehabilitation. A movement toward a more recovery-oriented direction and toward individuality has been noted in some municipalities in Sweden <xref rid=\"b57\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[57]</xref>, though this has still not been implemented at large. Some municipalities have no rehabilitation services at all, while some offer only one-off interventions, usually in the form of prescribing aids; only a few offer integrated, long-term rehabilitation in collaboration between rehab staff and HS. Additionally, collaborations between these roles and responsibilities have been pointed out as a challenge, and the competence level among the HS is generally low <xref rid=\"b39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[39]</xref>.</p>\\n        <p>Therefore, the ELR model was offered to and implemented within municipalities in northern and middle Sweden that agreed to take part in a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) project <xref rid=\"b45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[45]</xref>, including a web-based educational package for the rehab- and housing staff, which examined the effects of ELR compared to &#x201C;treatment as usual&#x201D; from the perspective of residents\\' personal recovery and quality of life. The full project was pre-registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05056415. Parallel to the RCT, the research team also wanted to understand how the participants made sense of and described the rehabilitation they had just undergone with the ELR, forming this narrative inquiry study.</p>\\n      </sec>\\n      <sec id=\"s2.2\">\\n        <label>2.2.</label>\\n        <title>Intervention&#x2014;The Everyday Life Rehabilitation (ELR) intervention</title>\\n        <p>Given the health inequity and activity deprivation of the target group and the scarcity of collaborative and integrated re/habilitative methods in the supported housing accommodation context, the ELR was designed and developed <xref rid=\"b36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[36]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[45]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"b48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[48]</xref> based on the best evidence for different mediating components and experiences from user-, praxis-, and stakeholder representatives to meet these challenges and legislative demands, and to improve and transform the rehabilitation efforts towards more person-centered, motivational, activity-, and recovery-oriented efforts.</p>\\n        <p>The focus of the intervention is to promote personal recovery through engagement in personally meaningful and enriching activities chosen by each participant and supported by occupational therapists (OTs) and the housing staff (HS) <xref rid=\"b47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[47]</xref>. ELR is a complex intervention that targets complex needs in a complex context, including several interventional components and actors: residents, OTs, HS, and managers (<xref rid=\"publichealth-11-04-062-g001\" ref-type=\"fig\">Figure 1</xref>).</p>\\n        <p>ELR was delivered through integrated rehabilitation based on &#x201C;outreach&#x201D; efforts directly to residents, applying a preparation-, change-, and anchoring-phase, described in an invitation brochure as a personalized opportunity of change towards increased quality of life, enrichening activities, and personal recovery.</p>\\n        <p>ELR was provided by weekly encounters with OTs, building a personally designed rehabilitation plan with a duration of six months, and next, in line with the plan, exploring and training in real life activities based on the participant choice to gradually reach the personal goal. In parallel, and in close collaboration, daily support was provided by the HS. The approaches of the professionals promote hope, self-discovery, and shared decision-making shaped in partnership with the participant/resident (see <xref rid=\"publichealth-11-04-062-g001\" ref-type=\"fig\">Figure 1</xref>).</p>\\n      </sec>\\n      <sec id=\"s2.3\">\\n        <label>2.3.</label>\\n        <title>Recruitment, participants, settings, and data collection</title>\\n        <p>The narrative analysis seeks depth rather than breadth of experience.

I actually had another option too; I thought of something creative because earlier in my life, when I was young, I have also been doing creative things, but not in recent years either... but I still chose to experience nature first-hand... felt that it could give me the most and enrich me the most...</italic>\\n</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>According to Anne, the most challenging part was finding the energy and will to do something for herself, as she had lost all the energy in her body and had forgotten the capacity she held within herself. Even though it was a major step for her to get into nature, she had a great experience during her first outing, which motivated her to continue exploring and engaging in outdoor activities.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">Yes, it was a strong experience; I wanted more. I want to continue. I felt it gave me something fresh and soothing; it filled me with a lust for life and calmness. I felt balanced, fulfilled, uplifted</italic>.</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>During her rehabilitation, she started with small progressive steps supported by the OT, such as going to a nearby forest path with a blanket, finding a clearing, and sitting down to look at the forest, breathe, and take nature in. According to Anne, the experience was simple and effective and was enriched by the many impressions that nature gave her. From there, she continued to explore nature\\'s power through various activities, such as going for walks, collecting materials, and creative writing based on her nature experiences.</p>\\n          <p>For Anne, experiencing nature was a turning point for her. She explains how she found her way back to nature and discovered its healing power, which gave her energy, balance, and belonging, and helped her to cope with her challenges. Moreover, she mentions that she discovered essential things, such as the nuances, colors, smells, and the beauty of nature, which helped her regain positive feelings such as hope, believing in herself, contentment, and self-worth as a human being. This helped her overcome her initial doubts and uncertainties and gradually build her confidence and sense of self-efficacy.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">Hope for life and some meaning in that life... support to rediscover the healing power of nature. I would say I have gone from a life of vagueness and slow disintegration of myself, with anxiety pounding on without being able to do anything about it... to... to filling life with a little more meaning, some positive feelings, to seek impressions from other environments, discover nuances, discover feelings, discover what I want...discover myself, let myself take part in life, nature, impressions..</italic>.</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>This indicates that the rehabilitation helped Anne gain a new perspective on herself and her life. She recounts feeling more positive and having a sense of meaning in everyday life, representing a shift in her overall attitude toward life. Rediscovering the healing power of nature played a role in helping Anne view herself in a new and positive way. Self-discovery was a gradual process that involved exploring new environments, discovering nuances, and allowing herself to be a part of life. This newfound connection to nature allowed her to tap into her inner strength, confidence, and creativity, which she was not previously aware of.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">... did I say I have written a couple of poems too? It started with single words but turned into lines, short lines that I can look back on as a turning point when I let nature make room in my life again</italic>.</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>Anne engaged in meaningful activities that allowed her to establish a connection with herself and the world around her. This enabled her to discover herself, find new passions and a sense of purpose, and awake to a deeper appreciation for life. Anne claims that the experience in nature was transformative and had a significant impact on her overall well-being. According to Anne, the HS will provide ongoing support to help her maintain her engagement in activities in nature after the rehabilitation period, even during the winter.</p>\\n        </sec>\\n        <sec id=\"s3.1.2\">\\n          <label>3.1.2.</label>\\n          <title>Transformed through voluntary work: personal growth, value, and a sense of accomplishment</title>\\n          <p>Nils is a man in his 30s who has always wanted to make a difference in other people\\'s lives, but he says he was unable to act on it until he received the support, guidance, and structure provided by an OT. Nils chose to participate in ELR because he was attracted to the personally-oriented rehabilitation and the opportunity to enhance his life through meaningful activities, as described in the leaflet he read about ELR.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">I read the leaflet and thought, why not? I will not become a serf. I can stop if it does not feel good (laughs)... then I thought... that it might still enrich my life a little more, as it said in the leaflet.

That is something out of the ordinary</italic>.</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>Despite Nils\\' previous sedentary lifestyle and low energy levels, he tells he was willing to take on his first challenge: choosing the activity he would invest effort in during the ELR program. He describes that he had several ideas in mind for activities, and with the OTs guidance and questions about his values, interests, and aspirations, he could narrow down his options. Eventually, he chose an area he had been thinking about for a long time&#x2014;helping older people with outdoor tasks.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">Yes, it felt meaningful and important to be able to help someone else. I do not mean much to anyone else, but I felt that I wanted to do it, that I wanted to be able to help someone else</italic>.</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>Nils explains how it was important for him to choose an activity that was not just temporary or superficial, but rather something real, challenging, and meaningful that would benefit someone else. The first person he chose to help was a relative on his mother\\'s side, who had difficulty walking and needed help with outdoor chores. Consequently, his second challenge was, together with the OT, to create a plan to help him achieve this goal. The plan was designed to prevent him from overexerting himself and to help him establish a routine. Nils remarks that the plan was based on gradual steps to help him succeed and to avoid failure, which was important to him.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">... I was given a plan so that I would take it step by step, not go out too hard at the beginning, so to speak... it was probably good not to make too big of promises either. The Occupational therapist is the one who made the plan concrete, and she accompanied me during the first few months until I had established a routine of how I would do it</italic>.</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>During rehabilitation, Nils recounts how he dedicated his time and effort to various physical activities, such as shoveling snow, chopping ice, sanding, cutting grass, and raking, to help his elderly relative. He found these activities to be physically challenging, but also gave him a sense of satisfaction of having done something real. He was motivated by the challenge of the tasks and his desire to help someone in need, which allowed him to overcome the difficulties he encountered.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">Very significant! I feel that I am helpful. It gives me a good feeling in my body when I have exerted myself physically; I feel tired but satisfied. I feel that I can make a difference in someone else\\'s life.

He also experienced some resistance and apprehension when faced with the tasks he had to complete. Nils recounts there was one instance when he did not feel well and could not complete a task as planned. Despite occasional difficulties, Nils successfully carried out the activities according to the plan and adapted to the weather conditions. For instance, during mid-January, there was plenty of snow shoveling to be done, and although Nils felt he could have done more, he expressed satisfaction with his commitment to the plan.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">... sometimes I have felt resistance or some kind of apprehension about whether I will be able to do it, but it has still gone well... there was probably one time when I was not feeling well that I could not do what we had said and planned for... but all other times I have done the work according to plan and according to the forces of the weather [laughs]</italic>.</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>By successfully achieving his initial goal, Nils\\' self-confidence increased, making him feel more proactive, self-motivated, and empowered. Nils mentions that he started going to Joakim\\'s place more on his own, doing chores, and even calling his relative to ask whether he wanted anything done in particular. In a way, he exceeded his own expectations by pushing himself further than he had initially planned. As Nils continued his volunteer work, he began to receive positive feedback and recognition. This validation of his voluntary work helped reinforce his motivation and value as a person.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">...

Nevertheless, his participation in the ELR had a significant impact on him, allowing him to recognize his strengths and qualities and appreciate the small positive things in his life that he was previously unaware of.</p>\\n          <p>According to Gustav, the OT helped him set personal goals and took conscious, planned, and supervised steps to achieve them. Gustav was motivated to engage in meaningful activities such as slalom, and social contacts, which were big steps for him. In order to reach those goals, he was encouraged to start practicing yoga, work out at a gym, take short walks, and gradually increase his physical capacity alongside a physiotherapist (PT). Additionally, the OT encouraged him to take even more significant steps, such as attending the opera, which he describes as a revolutionary experience. He loves music and had never been to the opera before.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">I am a film and music geek, so I enjoy all types of music, and I usually joke and say that if someone has a favourite artist or group, I have probably listened to them.

It was a huge... what an experience [laughs]</italic>.</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>By achieving these goals, Gustav was able to overcome any doubts he had about coping with his situation. This experience provided him with a sense of accomplishment and self-belief, and boosted his self-efficacy and motivation, which encouraged him to set more ambitious goals and work towards them in the future.

One of the ways he was encouraged to do this was by participating in the local pilot leisure project, which provided opportunities for social contacts and personal growth. He recalls how it was so much fun to have the freedom to wish for exactly what he wanted to do. Gustav yearned for a companion who shared his passion for movies and believed that there were others who also felt alone and wished for someone to go out with or simply share a cup of coffee. They started meeting up, grilling sausages, and hanging out.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">It was so fun. You could wish for whatever you wanted. So, they really tried to put this together like ...me, people who love movies. I would like to have a movie buddy to go with. I thought that there were more people like me who are alone, sitting in an apartment, and love movies and have no one to go with, or just to go and have a coffee</italic>.</p>\\n          </disp-quote>\\n          <p>The leisure group was more than just a pastime for Gustav, as it brought him valuable connections, motivation, companionship, and friendships. He speaks highly of the group, which has become a crucial part of his social life and provides him with a sense of support. This helped him overcome isolation, loneliness, build confidence, and take control of his social life.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">And then the great thing about leisure time is that they have this idea that...

Moreover, he suggests that the leisure group should organize more in-person activities, such as watching movies or visiting the bathhouse, to facilitate socialization and connection among members. Additionally, Gustav conveys that he still has difficulties leaving his home and suggests that he would have benefited from tips and support to improve his social skills, which he believes would enhance the overall experience of being part of the ELR group.</p>\\n          <disp-quote>\\n            <p><italic toggle=\"yes\">That I get stuck... at least I do, and I still have some difficulty with this social aspect and saying...

Because that is when I, that is when I am really satisfied with the job that I have received help with, to find myself again&#x201D;</italic>.</p>\\n          <p>This ongoing communication provided a supportive environment for the participants to express their concerns, emotions, and aspirations. It enabled the OTs to tailor interventions and support mechanisms according to individual needs, making the rehabilitation process more effective.</p>\\n        </sec>\\n      </sec>\\n      <sec id=\"s3.3\">\\n        <label>3.3.</label>\\n        <title>Theoretical illuminations and reflections</title>\\n        <p>Researchers have found that meaningful everyday activities can be powerful positive influences on health, wellbeing <xref rid=\"b59\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[59]</xref>, and personal recovery <xref rid=\"b32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[32]</xref>. However, for this target group in this context, the &#x201C;everyday doing&#x201D; does not come naturally&#x2014;rather it has to be facilitated through conscious methods, participatory approaches, and staff collaboration.</p>\\n        <sec id=\"s3.3.1\">\\n          <label>3.3.1.</label>\\n          <title>How the stories were told</title>\\n          <p>The narratives and the identified storylines shed knowledge on <bold>what</bold> can be achieved in a relatively short time period, <bold>how</bold> it can be achieved, and moreover, <bold>how</bold> it is spoken about and interpreted in interactions through shared stories, experiences, and identified elements. Their stories are characterized by being straight to the point and concrete, identifying what has been helpful and putting into words how important elements worked.</p>\\n          <p>In this study, all seven participants indicated that their support, offered to them during the ELR period, guided them to discover and develop through enrichening doing, being, and belonging, and furthermore, that it played a major role in their success of their everyday life rehabilitation and personal recovery process. Through the stories shared, we can also notice how this directly influenced the participants\\' personal recovery pathway, as they mentioned identity development, self-worth, hope, connectedness, etc.</p>\\n          <p>Notably, the participants\\' stories contained several concepts and language from the ELR period, including motivational strategies and recovery components, indicating that they talked and reflected on this during their process and now re-used some of this wording in their own stories, integrated into their own understanding when they recalled how support and progress occurred. Concepts such as hope, inner motivation, possibilities, self-determination, values, meaning, identity, mattering, connectedness, and empowerment all relate to the recovery paradigm.</p>\\n          <p>Through exploring the residents\\' rehabilitation stories and how they are narrated, the study offers insights into how the participants depict the significance and sense-making of their newfound engagement in everyday life activities, and how they attribute value in the support provided along their recovery processes. The narratives give voice and depth to their experiences and the major changes that took place over a short period of time. What they particularly emphasize regarding various aspects of the methods and support they received is completely in line with a person-centered approach in its true sense, which takes into account the unique and changing needs, as perceived and told by the person, the comprehensive perspectives, and the life circumstances of each individual <xref rid=\"b60\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[60]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b61\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[61]</xref>. By adopting a person-centered approach, the ELR intervention aims to promote the participant agency and increase their engagement in their own recovery process and everyday life <xref rid=\"b62\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[62]</xref>.</p>\\n        </sec>\\n        <sec id=\"s3.3.2\">\\n          <label>3.3.2.</label>\\n          <title>Theoretical elaboration explicating how recovery through enrichening and meaningful activity took place</title>\\n          <p>A theoretical perspective of doing-being-becoming-belonging, often used within occupational therapy contexts <xref rid=\"b42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[42]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b63\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[63]</xref>, apparently relates closely to the recovery process. Proposing a &#x201C;do-be-do-be-do-circular process&#x201D; applied to the participants\\' stories could help in understanding how the doing of enrichening activity (input, meaning, growth, pride, emotions) influences one\\'s being (mind, positive identity, self-worth, hope), which, in turn, influences the sense of belonging (social and societal connectedness) and becoming (developing skills, competences, roles, future prospects, empowerment/personal agency) in ongoing, inter-circular processes. Thus, how a negative spiral&#x2014;often seen in supported housing context&#x2014;can be turned into a positive spiral of hope, other impressions, worth, mattering, will, identity, personal agency, etc., even in persons who had previously reached a state of mind and level of sedentariness where they could not, by themselves, instigate change or describe what mattered to them.</p>\\n          <p>Beside the rich stories of how doing activities influenced their personal recovery, the participants\\' stories, recalling their personalized rehabilitation processes, illustrated how support and signals of hope awakened inner motivation for personal progress, how weekly meetings supported participants\\' self-determination, identity, and exploration in activities, and how a transparent process and validating communication enabled their personal progress.</p>\\n          <p>A recovery paradigm was applied in the ELR program and transformed to the personal processes; moreover, it was also applied as an overall theoretical framework in our narrative analysis to contextualize the findings and provide a theoretical lens to interpret the data, thus offering a broader perspective on the participants\\' descriptions of their experiences with ELR. The study findings suggest that meaningful activity can play a vital role in facilitating personal recovery. The participants\\' narratives underscore the crucial role of engaging in everyday life activities to foster hope, motivation, self-value, connectedness, mattering, and a sense of purpose in life. Participating in activities that they had chosen enabled participants to overcome the challenges they faced and to better manage their emotions while feeling valued, confident, and connected. The importance of rediscovering one\\'s identity and cultivating a positive self-image through meaningful activity was emphasized by the participants. This aligns with existing discussions and research on the personal recovery paradigm within the context of supported accommodations, emphasizing the role of meaningful activities in facilitating the personal recovery of individuals with an SMI <xref rid=\"b64\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[64]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b65\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[65]</xref>.</p>\\n        </sec>\\n      </sec>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec id=\"s4\">\\n      <label>4.</label>\\n      <title>Discussion and concluding remarks</title>\\n      <p>The findings of this study indicated that the ELR focus on personally meaningful and enriching activities, achievable goals, and personalized support, can be highly valuable in facilitating personal recovery in individuals with SMI. By considering each individual\\'s perspectives and life circumstances, the ELR intervention provided a tailored approach to rehabilitation that was perceived as relevant and meaningful to the participants. This approach allowed them to rediscover their sense of identity, motivation, hope, confidence, connectedness, sense of purpose, and agency, which are essential components of personal recovery <xref rid=\"b31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[31]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>In addition to the benefits of engaging in meaningful activity, our findings underscore the benefit of spending time outdoors and in nature for the participants\\' recovery process. The participants frequently mentioned how activities such as watching and sensing beautiful views, nature walks, shoveling snow, gardening, and skiing provided them with a sense of purpose, balance, calm, and connection with themselves and to the world around them. Our findings are consistent with studies which demonstrated that spending time in green and blue spaces <xref rid=\"b66\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[66]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b67\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[67]</xref> has numerous mental health benefits, including an improved mood, reduced stress levels, and increased feelings of well-being.</p>\\n      <p>The participants\\' stories highlighted the importance of the support they received to enable them to express their will, make choices, value, and engage in personally meaningful activities. Allowing the participants to make choices about their rehabilitation process and everyday life issues positively impacted their motivation, confidence, and commitment. This finding aligns with previous research which emphasized the importance of offering individuals the chance to make choices during their recovery process. When individuals feel empowered to make decisions, they are more likely to invest in their own recovery process and work towards their goals with greater dedication <xref rid=\"b33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[33]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b68\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[68]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b69\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[69]</xref>. Therefore, rehabilitation programs that prioritize individual choices and involvement tend to be more effective in promoting positive outcomes for the participants <xref rid=\"b70\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[70]</xref>.</p>\\n      <p>All the participants\\' narratives emphasized the importance of achieving the goals set during rehabilitation. These findings are consistent with previous research that highlighted the importance of goal-setting in promoting successful outcomes in mental health interventions <xref rid=\"b71\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[71]</xref>. Self-chosen, clear, and achievable goals tailored to the individual\\'s needs and abilities can help maintain motivation and keep the participants focused on the recovery process <xref rid=\"b35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[35]</xref>,<xref rid=\"b36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[36]</xref>.</p>\\n      <sec id=\"s4.1\">\\n        <label>4.1.</label>\\n        <title>Concluding remarks</title>\\n        <p>These findings enhanced our comprehension of how engaging in meaningful activities can aid in the rehabilitation and recovery process of individuals with an SMI. Through the narrative analysis, we found that the participants created meaning through their engagement in everyday life activities in various ways, such as rediscovering personal identity and regaining self-confidence, re-awakening their motivation and lust for life, engaging in meaningful social roles, and improving social and physical skills. Some mentioned that it helped them manage their emotions and feel valued.</p>\\n        <p>The participants also expressed how the opportunity to make choices about their rehabilitation process had a positive impact on their motivation and commitment. Spending time in social and/or outdoor spaces was also highlighted as a significant contributor to their sense of purpose, accomplishment, and connection to the world around them. The participants found meaning in engaging in activities that were self-chosen and tailored to their interests, needs, and abilities. Additionally, they underlined the importance of getting support during the process of exploration and change.</p>\\n        <p>Overall, the narratives illustrated how engaging in meaningful activities within a person-centered, motivating, communicative, and supportive context could promote personal recovery among individuals with SMIs living in supported housing. By fostering a sense of value, meaning, autonomy, and social connectedness, programs such as the ELR have the potential to empower individuals to lead fulfilling lives despite the challenges they may face.</p>\\n        <p>The study underscores the need for interventions that prioritize meaningful activities and are sensitive to the complexity of the personal recovery process, particularly within the unique context of supported housing facilities. Approaches that prioritize meaningful activities have shown promise in supporting personal recovery. Future research should continue to explore how these interventions can benefit individuals in these settings, with a focus on identifying the most effective strategies to promote personal recovery, a quality of life, and reducing the stigma associated with an SMI.</p>\\n        <p>As persons with SMIs are given more opportunities to participate in meaningful everyday life activities, they may gain valuable tools and resources that help them discover their own true potential, shift a negative spiral towards a positive, develop a sense of purpose, and take ownership of their recovery journey, which can contribute to a fulfilling and meaningful life.</p>\\n      </sec>\\n      <sec id=\"s4.2\">\\n        <label>4.2.</label>\\n        <title>Methodological considerations</title>\\n        <p>The material includes thick descriptions from a representative sample, which makes the findings transferable to a similar context. However, the results of this narrative inquiry study, which included seven participants of the ELR rehabilitation intervention, cannot be transferred to all people with SMIs living in supported accommodations. Nevertheless, it provides subjective and complex insights and directions for future studies that focus on intervention approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the activity-based and personal recovery pathways in rehabilitative practice communities.</p>\\n        <p>The stories have shown how important it is to give voice and offers of rehabilitation to marginalized, easy-to-ignore groups. Allowing participants to share their stories and perspectives may provide an opportunity to recognize and appreciate their expertise as service users.</p>\\n        <p>The analysis was enhanced through continuous comparisons and negotiations of the findings by the authors, using triangulation to accurately reflect the residents\\' experiences. In-depth subjective narratives and theoretical illumination contextualized the findings in the prevailing living conditions. This contextualization increases the possibility of relating the results to how other marginalized and disfavored residents with SMIs perceive their opportunities for transformation in everyday life.</p>\\n        <p>As OTs and intervention-researchers in public health, aligning with health equity as well as narrative meaning-making, both authors\\' pre-understanding of the topic influenced the interactions and interpretations of the data collected from conversations with informants, and during the analysis phase <xref rid=\"b72\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[72]</xref>. Regarding reflexivity <xref rid=\"b72\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[72]</xref>, throughout, we aimed to remain transparent, open-minded and critically reflective to our own perspectives\\' influence on the interpretations.</p>\\n        <p>The predominantly positive stories shared by the participants can be attributed partly from the fact that six out of seven participants achieved their goals and the seventh participant came close to reaching her goal within the six-month rehabilitation phase. This period was described as an unexpectedly positive and transformative experience in their lives. From a critical perspective, this might partly relate to the fact that they were probably grateful to be given the chance to participate in the intervention. Furthermore, the positive stories could have been influenced by the role played by the interviewers, who presented ourselves as OTs that pursued research, which could possibly be associated with the guidance they received from their OTs during their ongoing change. It is also important to point out that the narrative approach and the type of conversational interviews that rendered the data material, and then formed the basis for analysis, included a dynamic interaction between the participants and the interviewers/analysts <xref rid=\"b72\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[72]</xref>.</p>\\n      </sec>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec id=\"s5\">\\n      <title>Use of AI tools declaration</title>\\n      <p>The authors declare they have not used Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in the creation of this article.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n  </body>\\n  <back>\\n    <ack>\\n      <p>This study is part of a larger trial, funded by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE 2021&#x2013;01391).

Hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia boost excessive reactive oxygen species generation by elevated mitochondrial respiration, increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity, and enhanced pro-oxidative processes, including protein kinase C pathways, hexosamine, polyol, and advanced glycation endproducts, which exacerbate oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the onset of diabetes and its associated complications by impairing insulin production, increasing insulin resistance, maintaining hyperglycemic memory, and inducing systemic inflammation.

A permanent deficiency of insulin production in T1DM patients is mainly caused by continuous autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells or maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA mutations that impair mitochondrial activity. T1DM has an early age at onset and is most typically diagnosed in children and young adults. Once diagnosed, T1DM patients may experience various disease-related issues, such as a lower verbal intelligence quotient, cognitive deficits, memory impairment, and even a shorter life expectancy.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>]</sup> Both genetic and environmental factors affect the function of beta cells and the sensitivity of various tissues to insulin, leading to T2DM. T2DM is a complicated metabolic syndrome in which impaired carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism results in raised blood levels of glucose and lipids.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]</sup> Chronically elevated glucose and lipid levels activate various processes that impede insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, alter glucose production in hepatocytes, reduce glucose utilization in peripheral tissues, and cause insulin resistance.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>]</sup> Similarly, GDM is also a metabolic complication that results in placental and fetal glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation during pregnancy.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]</sup> The failure of beta cells to adequately respond to the increased insulin demand during pregnancy results in different degrees of hyperglycemia, bringing critical short- and long-term health risks for the mother and the offspring.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>]</sup> Moreover, chronic metabolic stress in patients with diabetes can cause problems such as cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, and impaired wound healing.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"R8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>]</sup></p>\\n      <p>Metabolic dysfunction in patients with diabetes disturbs redox homeostasis and causes oxidative stress because of an imbalance between the production and removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS).<sup>[<xref rid=\"R9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>]</sup> At a physiological level, ROS resulting from increased oxygen consumption at high glucose levels serve as signaling molecules to induce glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), a primary function of pancreatic beta cells.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]</sup> However, chronic hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia induce persistent ROS production from elevated mitochondrial respiration and increased activity of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner. Furthermore, hyperglycemia also enhances multiple pro-oxidative metabolic pathways, including the formation of oxidized advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), the hexosamine pathway, and the polyol pathway, aggravating oxidative stress.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]</sup> The elevated polyol pathway inhibits the production of antioxidant glutathione (GSH) by largely consuming NADPH, while promoting the ROS production from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase. The accumulation of uridine diphosphate <italic toggle=\"yes\">N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway triggers the hyperactivity of <italic toggle=\"yes\">O</italic>-linked <italic toggle=\"yes\">N</italic>-acetylglucosamine transferase, leading to toxic and oxidative damage to proteins in patients with diabetes. Enhanced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate activates NOX enzymes by inducing the diacylglycerol (DAG)-PKC pathway and the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) axis. In addition to mitochondrial electron transport enzymes and the NOX family, various enzymes, including xanthine oxidase, uncoupled nitric oxide synthase (NOS), lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenase, play a significant role in generating or transforming free radicals in diabetes. Meanwhile, patients with diabetes exhibit a compromised antioxidant defense, as indicated by decreased levels of ROS-detoxifying enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and reduced production of antioxidants, such as GSH and NADPH [Figure <xref rid=\"F1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>]. Notably, hyperglycemia increases NADPH consumption by enhancing the polyol pathway and reduces NADPH production from the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to insufficient GSH generation and a weakened cellular antioxidant capacity in patients with diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>]</sup> Oxidative stress together with epigenetic changes and the inflammatory response worsen diabetes or contribute to the development of diabetes complications.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>]</sup></p>\\n      <fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\">\\n        <label>Figure 1</label>\\n        <caption>\\n          <p>Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia induce oxidative stress in diabetes. During hyperglycemia, increased mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation promotes the TCA cycle, which in turn promotes lipid synthesis and ROS production. A high glucose level can also enhance the generation of ROS from pro-oxidative pathways, such as the AGE and PKC pathways, owing to an increase in GA3P, the hexosamine and polyol pathways due to a rise in F-6-P and glucose, respectively. The elevated polyol pathway causes a large amount consumption of NADPH, which is required for the regeneration of GSH and the accumulation of NADH, which promotes ROS production from NADH oxidase. The accumulation of UDP-GlcNAc in the hexosamine pathway triggers the hyperactivity of <italic toggle=\"yes\">O</italic>-glucosamine-<italic toggle=\"yes\">N</italic>-acetyl transferase, leading to toxic effects and oxidative damage to proteins in diabetes. Hyperglycemia promotes the activation of NOX and the formation of ROS through inducing the DAG-PKC pathway and the AGEs-RAGE axis. In addition, saturated NEFAs can also promote ROS production in the peroxisome. Nevertheless, antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, catalase, and GSH-Px are impaired in diabetes, worsening the oxidative stress.

Beta cells are unique in that nearly all glucose flows into mitochondrial oxidative activity, enabling quick insulin production and secretion in response to elevated extracellular glucose levels.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]</sup> The physiological level of ROS resulting from increased oxygen consumption acts as a signaling molecule to induce GSIS.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>]</sup> In diabetes, however, the constant increase in glycolytic flux and mitochondrial respiration in response to hyperglycemia leads to continual ROS generation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. Moreover, deficient levels of SOD, catalase, and GSH-Px render beta cells extremely susceptible to oxidative stress.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, persistent excessive oxidative stress significantly increases the risk of beta cell failure by promoting cell death and reducing insulin production [Figure <xref rid=\"F2\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>].</p>\\n        <fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\">\\n          <label>Figure 2</label>\\n          <caption>\\n            <p>Oxidative stress inhibits insulin production and causes insulin resistance. Oxidative stress results in insulin resistance by impairing insulin production and secretion in beta cells and inhibiting insulin signaling in muscles, fat, and liver cells. Physiologically elevated extracellular glucose levels quickly enhance the glycolytic flux and TCA cycle activity, which boosts ATP generation in beta cells. The elevated ATP/ADP ratio causes a lower K<sup>+</sup> outflow and a greater extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which promotes subsequent insulin secretion. The oxidative stress caused by a persistent high glucose level during diabetes induces cell apoptosis by activating PUMA. Oxidative stress also induces the expression of the proinflammatory factor NF-&#x3BA;B and inhibits the expression of the MAFA-PDX-mediated insulin gene. ROS can also activate UCP2, which reduces ATP formation and prevents insulin granule release. In insulin-targeting cells, ROS inhibit insulin signaling transduction to the intracellular level through activating the JNK and MAPK pathways, thereby inhibiting the translocation of GLUT4, glycogen production, and protein synthesis, resulting in insulin resistance. The impaired glucose uptake and cellular metabolism render cells to depend more on the beta-oxidation of FFAs for energy, which further increases ROS generation and insulin resistance.

PUMA-dependent activation of mitochondrial apoptosis is responsible for the beta cell loss induced by lipotoxic stress or DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 3 deficiency.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]</sup> Additionally, excess mitochondrial ROS activates caspase-3 and the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade by increasing thioredoxin-interacting protein expression, contributing to beta cell loss in young New Zealand obese mice.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]</sup></p>\\n        <p>Persistent excessive ROS reduces the expression and release of insulin during diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>]</sup> The excessive ROS generated from both mitochondria and NOX enzymes can inhibit insulin secretion in pancreatic islets by inhibiting critical transcription factors, such as pancreatic and duodenal homeo1 (PDX-1) and Maf BZIP transcription factor A (MafA).<sup>[<xref rid=\"R22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]</sup> The ROS-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway promotes the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1 and decreases its transcriptional activity, thereby suppressing insulin expression.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]</sup> Through activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun, ROS also enhance the degradation of MafA. Meanwhile, alleviating ROS by overexpressing GSH-Px inhibits the degradation of intranuclear MafA, which has been shown to reverse diabetes in db/db mice.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>]</sup> Additionally, the inhibition of other transcription factors, such as V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B (MafB), paired box 6, NK6 homeo1, neuronal differentiation 1, NK2 homeobox 2, forkhead box A2, and KIR6.2, is also involved in exogenous ROS-impaired beta cell maturation and insulin secretion.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>]</sup> Notably, the generation of ROS from mitochondria and NOX enzymes, as well as the antioxidant status like nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation, exhibits daily oscillations, suggesting that the intracellular redox balance is controlled by a circadian clock. The disturbance of a core clock component results in a loss of Nrf2 rhythmicity, an increase in mitochondria-generated ROS, and a deficiency in GSIS.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the cell-autonomous activity of basic helix-loop-helix ARNT-like protein 1 (Bmal1), a principal driver of the molecular clock in mammals, maintains the appropriate beta cell function by mitigating oxidative stress.

Insulin typically directs nutrients to be stored as glycogen and triglyceride by integrating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. The failure of these processes drives hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in insulin-resistant individuals.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]</sup> The high circulating glucose and fatty acid levels trigger oxidative stress in peripheral tissues. In addition, elevated fatty acid levels amplify hepatic anaplerotic/cataplerotic pathways, resulting in a corresponding increase in mitochondrial ROS.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]</sup> The switch of energy metabolism from glycolysis to lipid oxidation during diabetes results in high levels of FFAs, NADH, and ROS.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>]</sup> Notably, excessive amounts of nutrients like palmitate and glucose induce ROS generation from NOX4 in adipocytes, resulting in insulin resistance throughout the body. Similarly, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3B1;)- or dexamethasone-induced ROS causes insulin resistance via activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in adipocytes. Nevertheless, NOX4 deficiency in adipocytes has been demonstrated to reduce inflammation in adipose tissue and delay the onset of insulin resistance in obesity.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]</sup></p>\\n        <p>Oxidative stress exacerbates insulin resistance by impairing the insulin cascade in peripheral tissues [Figure <xref rid=\"F2\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>]. Normally, the classical insulin/insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) axis induces the transfer of glucose transporter type 4 from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane for transporting glucose.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>]</sup> However, excessive ROS activate the redox-sensitive signaling pathways, including p38MAPK, JNK, and NF-&#x3BA;B, which all enhance the inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 and suppress insulin signaling in diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>]</sup> The mitochondria-generated ROS reduce insulin signaling due to TNF-&#x3B1; exposure and paraoxonase 1 deficiency by causing the p38MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of IRS-1.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>]</sup> TNF-&#x3B1; and FFA-induced ROS activate JNK to induce the phosphorylation of IRS-1.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]</sup> Elevated levels of circulating cytokines, such as nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and TNF-&#x3B1;, activate the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-&#x3BA;B signaling pathways, which increase the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and inhibit glucose uptake.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>]</sup> The activation of PKC by DAG- or NOX-derived ROS results in inhibitory phosphorylation and degradation of IRSs, which lowers PI3K/AKT activity and causes insulin resistance.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>]</sup> Additionally, ROS inhibit the insulin signaling pathway by inducing redox modification of key regulators, including phosphatase and tensin homolog, AKT2, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, protein phosphatase 2A, diphenylene iodonium, and MAPK phosphatase-1.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R37\" ref-type=\"bibr\">37</xref>]</sup> For example, oxidization of IKK&#x3B2; at cysteine 179 inhibits IKK activation and NF-&#x3BA;B signaling, which might contribute to arsenic-induced insulin resistance.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]</sup> Therefore, through mediating oxidative modification of redox proteins and activating redox-sensitive signaling pathways, oxidative stress impairs the insulin signaling cascade and results in insulin resistance. Scavenging mitochondrial ROS by overexpressing mitochondrially localized catalase and CuZnSOD or adding mitochondria-targeted antioxidants can restore insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]</sup></p>\\n      </sec>\\n      <sec>\\n        <title>ROS perpetuate the hyperglycemic memory</title>\\n        <p>Persistent hyperglycemic stress exists in different organs of patients with diabetes even when their blood glucose levels are tightly controlled to normal levels, a phenomenon now referred to as hyperglycemic memory.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>]</sup> The sustained hyperglycemic memory following glucose normalization may be explained by the continued ROS production, which works with the epigenetic regulation and inflammatory effects to mediate a long-lasting deleterious effect<sup>[<xref rid=\"R40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]</sup> [Figure <xref rid=\"F3\" ref-type=\"fig\">3</xref>].</p>\\n        <fig position=\"float\" id=\"F3\">\\n          <label>Figure 3</label>\\n          <caption>\\n            <p>The vicious cycle of oxidative stress, epigenetic memory, and persistent inflammation in diabetes. (A) Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance induce a vicious cycle of oxidative stress, epigenetic memory, and persistent inflammation, which contribute to diabetes and its associated complications. (B) The hyperglycemic memory following glucose normalization is sustained by epigenetic modifications, which induce persistent ROS accumulation by overexpressing pro-oxidant enzymes and reducing antioxidant enzymes, even after normalizing the glucose levels. The prolonged ROS in turn sustain the harmful effects of hyperglycemia by epigenetic-mediated proinflammatory effects. (C) ROS in beta cells due to hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia generate ox-insulin peptides. It is subsequently recognized by DCs and activates cytotoxic T cells to attack beta cells. At the same time, M1-type macrophages in pancreatic islets generate and release inflammatory factors due to intracellular ROS, causing beta-cell apoptosis.

This epigenetic memory-maintained expression of p65 and its downstream genes, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, can be inhibited by limiting the mitochondrial production of ROS.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]</sup> Collectively, the prolonged ROS sustain the harmful effects of hyperglycemia by epigenetic causes, chronic oxidative damage, and proinflammatory effects independent of the actual glucose level, contributing to the onset of diabetes.</p>\\n      </sec>\\n      <sec>\\n        <title>Crosstalk between oxidative stress and systemic inflammation</title>\\n        <p>The high burden of inflammation is one remarkable characteristic of diabetes, its complications, and related conditions.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"R48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref>]</sup> It is now well-acknowledged that oxidative stress is closely linked to systemic inflammation, influencing the pathophysiology of numerous diabetes complications. Oxidative stress due to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders in diabetes activates proinflammatory transcription factors, such as NF-&#x3BA;B, and mediates the release of cytokines. These cytokines recruit and activate immune cells like macrophages to increase ROS generation, which results in chronic systemic inflammation.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref>]</sup></p>\\n        <p>Oxidative stress creates a cytotoxic inflammatory environment in the pancreatic islet, which provokes the specific destruction of beta cells.

The cytotoxic cytokines can further augment the proapoptotic and inflammatory responses in beta cells via inducing ROS generation from NOX enzymes, increasing NO synthesis by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and activating the non-canonical NF-&#x3BA;B pathway.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R53\" ref-type=\"bibr\">53</xref>]</sup> Chronic oxidative stress in conjunction with inflammation in the islet microenvironment can collectively boost beta cell destruction by M1-like macrophages and autoreactive T cell responses [Figure <xref rid=\"F3\" ref-type=\"fig\">3</xref>C].</p>\\n        <p>Oxidative modifications of proteins and lipids will form danger or pathogen-associated molecular patterns in the immune system, which trigger chronic inflammation and the development of diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R54\" ref-type=\"bibr\">54</xref>]</sup> For example, at the start of atherosclerosis, ROS generated from lysyl oxidase and myeloperoxidase in the artery wall exacerbate the oxidation and glycosylation of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), contributing to elevated circulating levels of oxidized LDLs (oxLDLs).

A lack of NO under oxidative stress reduces medullary blood flow and leads to chronic hypertension.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R68\" ref-type=\"bibr\">68</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the reduced bioactive NO due to its inactivation by ROS results in renal sodium retention through triggering tubular sodium reabsorption.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R69\" ref-type=\"bibr\">69</xref>]</sup> Altogether, reduced NO bioactivity as a result of oxidative stress is regarded as one of the factors causing EC dysfunction.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R70\" ref-type=\"bibr\">70</xref>]</sup></p>\\n        <p>Oxidative stress alters the retinal microvascular structure and function, including the thickness of the capillary basement membrane, the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), and the formation of acellular and occluded capillaries.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R71\" ref-type=\"bibr\">71</xref>]</sup> During the hyperglycemic state, ROS promote the expression of collagen, fibronectin, and ECM proteins in retinal ECs by activating several cytokines and transcription factors.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R72\" ref-type=\"bibr\">72</xref>]</sup> In addition, ROS-induced formation of AGEs impairs collagen degradation by inducing collagen cross-linking and altering ECM-based scaffolds, consequently increasing the vascular wall stiffness.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R73\" ref-type=\"bibr\">73</xref>]</sup> Oxidative stress-induced vascular endothelial growth factor and TNF-&#x3B1; expression decreases the expression of claudin-1 and zonula occludens-1, which are intercellular junctional proteins required for the normal structure of the BRB, resulting in increased retinal vascular permeability and BRB breakdown.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R74\" ref-type=\"bibr\">74</xref>]</sup> The destruction of the BRB by oxidative stress results in increased vascular permeability and the subsequent development of diabetes-related macular edema. Furthermore, persistent hyperglycemia activates PKC-&#x3B4; and downstream signaling cascades, resulting in pericyte death.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R75\" ref-type=\"bibr\">75</xref>]</sup> The loss of pericyte cells will progressively change the structure of retinal microvessels, disrupting the BRB.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R71\" ref-type=\"bibr\">71</xref>]</sup> Moreover, oxidative stress caused by hyperglycemia significantly promotes the generation of acellular and occluded capillaries by inducing angiogenesis and inflammation.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R76\" ref-type=\"bibr\">76</xref>]</sup></p>\\n        <p>Oxidative stress also disturbs the capillary or small artery vascular architecture, which renders tissues more susceptible to infection and activates leukocyte transport, speeding up the formation and evolution of diabetes-related ulcers. Additionally, smaller diameter end arteries may be more prone to microthromboembolism, which worsens local tissue ischemia and hypoxia in diabetes-related wounds.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R77\" ref-type=\"bibr\">77</xref>]</sup> In diabetes, oxidative stress-induced autonomic neuropathy of the sweat gland results in decreased skin sweating, aberrant thermoregulation, and dry and chapped skin, which impair the integrity and infection barrier ability of the skin.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R78\" ref-type=\"bibr\">78</xref>]</sup> Boosting oxidative stress by inhibiting SOD2 expression in neutrophils following lipopolysaccharide stimulation leads to neutrophil dysfunction and increases infection susceptibility in patients with diabetes-related kidney disease.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R79\" ref-type=\"bibr\">79</xref>]</sup></p>\\n      </sec>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec>\\n      <title>Therapeutic Approaches Targeting Redox Regulation in Diabetes and its Complications</title>\\n      <p>Growing experimental and clinical investigations have demonstrated that oxidative stress has a significant role in the development of diabetes complications<sup>[<xref rid=\"R11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>,<xref rid=\"R80\" ref-type=\"bibr\">80</xref>]</sup> [Supplementary Figure 1, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://links.lww.com/CM9/C89\" ext-link-type=\"uri\">http://links.lww.com/CM9/C89</ext-link>].

Here, we summarize some of these compounds according to their impact on redox regulation, including reducing the generation of oxidants, boosting the antioxidant defense, and inhibiting abnormal redox signaling.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R81\" ref-type=\"bibr\">81</xref>]</sup> Additionally, the benefits of supplementation with dietary antioxidants and appropriate exercise are discussed for patients with diabetes.</p>\\n      <sec>\\n        <title>Prevention of oxidant production</title>\\n        <p>Inhibition of ROS production is a fundamental strategy to mitigate oxidative stress and oxidative damage in patients with diabetes. Reagents that prevent the generation of mitochondrial ROS, including rotenone, mitoquinone (MitoQ), and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPOL), have been tested in clinical trials [Supplementary Table 1, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://links.lww.com/CM9/C89\" ext-link-type=\"uri\">http://links.lww.com/CM9/C89</ext-link>]. The complex I inhibitor rotenone exerts a protective effect on the pancreas in T1DM patients via attenuating mitochondrial ROS production.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R82\" ref-type=\"bibr\">82</xref>]</sup> Rotenone also effectively blocks ROS production in thylakoid cells of diabetes-related nephropathy patients, suppressing the high glucose-induced secretion of fibronectin from renal tubular cells and preventing the development of renal fibrosis.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R83\" ref-type=\"bibr\">83</xref>]</sup> The mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ has improved the function of renal tubular and glomerular cells in an insulin-deficient Ins2<sup>+/&#x2212;AkitaJ</sup> mouse model.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R84\" ref-type=\"bibr\">84</xref>]</sup> Similarly, the SOD mimetic TEMPOL ameliorates oxidative damage to the kidney, reducing proteinuria formation and renal tubular interstitial fibrosis in a rat model of diabetes-related nephropathy.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R85\" ref-type=\"bibr\">85</xref>]</sup></p>\\n        <p>NOX inhibitors also have emerged as a potential approach for treating diabetes and its complications.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R86\" ref-type=\"bibr\">86</xref>]</sup> Human retinal cell death caused by high glucose is reduced by the NOX4 inhibitor setanaxib (GKT137831), offering a potential treatment for diabetes-related retinopathy. In addition, GKT137831 attenuates atherosclerosis development in apolipoprotein E-deficient diabetic mice by preventing oxidative stress in response to hyperglycemia.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R87\" ref-type=\"bibr\">87</xref>]</sup> Moreover, some herbal medicines exhibit promising protective effects against diabetes by inhibiting NOX-derived ROS. Salvianolate, an herbal remedy from the roots of <italic toggle=\"yes\">Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, suppresses ROS generation from NOX4 by regulating the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and lessens oxidative damage to podocytes during exposure to high glucose.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R86\" ref-type=\"bibr\">86</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, inhibition of NOX2 activity by apocynin, a naturally occurring methoxy-substituted catechol found in the herb <italic toggle=\"yes\">Picrorhiza kurroa</italic>, has been shown to reduce cell death and improve the contractility of cardiomyocytes via reducing high glucose-induced ROS in cardiac myocytes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R87\" ref-type=\"bibr\">87</xref>]</sup></p>\\n      </sec>\\n      <sec>\\n        <title>Enhancing the antioxidant defense</title>\\n        <p>Patients with diabetes have a compromised antioxidant system due to the decreased expression of ROS-detoxifying enzymes and low levels of non-enzymatic scavengers. The expression of ROS-detoxifying enzymes is significantly lower in beta cells than in other cells, resulting in poor scavenging of excessive ROS. Additionally, several antioxidant systems, including the GSH-Px, GSH reductase, and peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase systems, depend on GSH and NADPH.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R88\" ref-type=\"bibr\">88</xref>]</sup> A considerable decrease in GSH has been observed in both human and experimental models of diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R89\" ref-type=\"bibr\">89</xref>]</sup> Additionally, the hyperglycemia-enhanced polyol pathway consumes a large amount of NADPH, inhibiting the regeneration of GSH from glutathione disulfide (GSSG).<sup>[<xref rid=\"R49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref>]</sup> Meanwhile, high glucose causes inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation, reducing NADPH production from the pentose phosphate pathway.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R90\" ref-type=\"bibr\">90</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the decreased amount of NADPH is not available to support the regeneration of GSH from GSSG, leading to a weakened cellular antioxidant capacity [Figure <xref rid=\"F1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>].<sup>[<xref rid=\"R91\" ref-type=\"bibr\">91</xref>]</sup> The impaired antioxidant ability in patients with diabetes aggravates the redox imbalance and oxidative damage, shedding new light on investigating diabetes treatment strategies based on boosting the antioxidant capacity.</p>\\n        <p>The protective benefits of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defense offer a therapeutic target for diabetes management. ROS prevent the proteasomal degradation of Nrf2 by inducing the oxidative modification of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1).<sup>[<xref rid=\"R92\" ref-type=\"bibr\">92</xref>]</sup> Current studies have shown that many substances can activate Nrf2 by targeting the cysteine residues of Keap1, including sulforaphane, curcumin, aspalathin, pterostilbene, oltipraz, and epigallocatechin 3-gallate.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]</sup> Cruciferous vegetables have a renoprotective function against streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice by modifying residues of Keap1 to inhibit the degradation of Nrf2.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R93\" ref-type=\"bibr\">93</xref>]</sup> Through the modification of Cys151 in Keap1 to increase the level of nuclear-localized Nrf2, curcumin delays the development of T2DM in animals by improving beta cell function and reducing insulin resistance.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R94\" ref-type=\"bibr\">94</xref>]</sup> Another strategy for activating Nrf2 is to promote the sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), also known as p62-mediated autophagic degradation of Keap1. Aspalathin from the rooibos plant directly interacts with p62, which drives the non-canonical activation of the Nrf2 pathway, protecting beta cells against glucotoxicity and oxidative stress.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R95\" ref-type=\"bibr\">95</xref>]</sup> Nrf2-enhanced expression of enzymes, including NOX, glutathione S-transferase (GST), SOD, and catalase, neutralize free radicals to prevent beta cells from oxidative damage during hyperglycemia and a high-fat diet (HFD).<sup>[<xref rid=\"R92\" ref-type=\"bibr\">92</xref>,<xref rid=\"R96\" ref-type=\"bibr\">96</xref>]</sup> Potent antioxidants, particularly certain plant extracts, can diminish oxidative damage in diabetes by boosting the expression of Nrf2-mediated detoxifying enzymes. For example, acorns of the <italic toggle=\"yes\">Quercus liaotungensis</italic> Koidz tree activate the Nrf2 pathway, which increases the expression and activity of SOD and catalase in the beta cells of mice with diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref>]</sup> In preclinical studies, trehalose was found to significantly reduce ROS and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in a dose-dependent manner by promoting Nrf2-mediated expression of SOD and catalase.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref>]</sup> In summary, modulating the Keap1/Nrf2/Antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway may be a potential therapeutic strategy for relieving diabetes and preventing diabetes-related end-organ injury.</p>\\n        <p>Increasing the expression or enhancing the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes is another strategy to alleviate oxidative stress in diabetes. The overexpression of mitochondria-localized catalase and CuZnSOD can restore insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and alleviate insulin resistance.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R97\" ref-type=\"bibr\">97</xref>]</sup> Chlorogenic acid, a phenolic component typically found in vegetables, protects beta cells by enhancing the activity of SOD, catalase, GSH-Px, and GST, thereby decreasing the levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, catalpol, isolated from <italic toggle=\"yes\">Rehmannia glutinosa</italic>, is a potent antioxidant that attenuates oxidative stress-induced damage by increasing the activities of SOD, catalase, and GSH-Px in the pancreas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R61\" ref-type=\"bibr\">61</xref>,<xref rid=\"R98\" ref-type=\"bibr\">98</xref>]</sup> In addition, some nanoparticles can be employed for tissue regeneration and wound healing due to their capacity to scavenge excess ROS.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref>,<xref rid=\"R99\" ref-type=\"bibr\">99</xref>]</sup> For example, manganese dioxide nanosheets can induce the decomposition of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into oxygen, effectively alleviating oxidative stress and assisting wound repair in diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R86\" ref-type=\"bibr\">86</xref>]</sup></p>\\n        <p>In addition to enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, supplementation with non-enzymatic antioxidants like GSH is another effective way to control diabetes. GSH deficiency due to an insufficient supply of the precursor amino acids cysteine and glycine is another important cause of oxidative stress in T2DM.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R100\" ref-type=\"bibr\">100</xref>]</sup> It has been discovered that giving rats with diabetes oral <italic toggle=\"yes\">N</italic>-acetylcysteine (NAC), a GSH precursor, lowers oxidative stress and improves endothelial function. Additionally, NAC enhances the NO-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation in the blood of patients with diabetes, which reduces their risk of thrombosis.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R100\" ref-type=\"bibr\">100</xref>]</sup> Antioxidants that target the mitochondria have been shown to maintain insulin sensitivity in animal models. In particular, ob/ob animals or HFD C57BL/6 mice had higher insulin sensitivity after treatment with manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride)(MnTBAP), a mitochondrial antioxidant.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R101\" ref-type=\"bibr\">101</xref>]</sup> Numerous clinical trials also have shown that antioxidants, including GSH, vitamin C, vitamin E, and &#x3B1;-lipoic acid, can improve insulin sensitivity in patients with diabetes [Supplementary Table 1, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://links.lww.com/CM9/C89\" ext-link-type=\"uri\">http://links.lww.com/CM9/C89</ext-link>].</p>\\n      </sec>\\n      <sec>\\n        <title>Targeting aberrant redox signaling</title>\\n        <p>Numerous redox signaling pathways have a vital function in the development of diabetes and its complications. Altering these redox signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT, NF-&#x3BA;B, and DAG-PKC pathways, may be a potential treatment for diabetes and related terminal organ injury.</p>\\n        <p>Activation of the JAK/STAT and NF-&#x3BA;B signaling pathways promotes the onset of diabetes and its complications by inducing the expression of genes related to oxidative stress and inflammation. Persistent STAT activation in suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1)-deficient mice exacerbates oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. In contrast, overexpression of SOCS1 inhibits the pathological JAK/STAT pathway-mediated inflammation, alleviating cardiovascular disease and renal dysfunction in patients with diabetes. Therefore, SOCS1 provides a viable target for the treatment of diabetes as a result of its inhibitory role on the JAK/STAT pathway.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R102\" ref-type=\"bibr\">102</xref>]</sup> Sinomenine, an alkaloid monomer obtained from the root of <italic toggle=\"yes\">Caulis sinomenii</italic>, exerts analgesic and immunosuppressive effects by increasing the expression of SOCS1.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R70\" ref-type=\"bibr\">70</xref>]</sup> Sinomenine inhibits the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which lowers the expression of inflammatory markers, including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and IL-6, and shields the kidneys of diabetic rats from oxidative injury.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R103\" ref-type=\"bibr\">103</xref>]</sup> It is well established that the activation of NF-&#x3BA;B by oxidative stress is another crucial inflammatory signaling pathway that significantly contributes to the development of diabetes. The protective effect of carvedilol against beta cell injury and the development of diabetes in mice depends on its inhibition of NF-&#x3BA;B, which reduces proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, IL-6, IFN-&#x3B3;, and TNF-&#x3B1;.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R104\" ref-type=\"bibr\">104</xref>]</sup></p>\\n        <p>As aforementioned, the hyperglycemic state of diabetes increases the production of DAG, which promotes cellular oxidative stress and damage by abnormally activating PKC. Wogonin, an herb with anti-inflammatory properties, scavenges DAG and oxidative radicals in mice with diabetes, thereby blocking the DAG-PKC pathway and attenuating the toxic effects of hyperglycemia in diabetic animals.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R105\" ref-type=\"bibr\">105</xref>]</sup> The intraperitoneal injection or oral vitamin E administration activates diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs), which can convert DAG into phosphatidic acid. The activated DGKs have been shown to suppress PKC activity to lessen podocyte damage and improve diabetes-related nephropathy in a mouse model.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R106\" ref-type=\"bibr\">106</xref>]</sup></p>\\n      </sec>\\n      <sec>\\n        <title>Exercise and dietary antioxidant supplements</title>\\n        <p>Generally, older people are more likely to suffer from T2DM, while younger people may become susceptible to diabetes as a result of obesity, a poor diet, or a lack of exercise.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]</sup> It has been demonstrated that people with diabetes who do not exercise have a three times higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease than the general population, while physical activity can reduce the excess risk, suggesting that physical activity can counteract the adverse cardiovascular effects of diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R107\" ref-type=\"bibr\">107</xref>]</sup> Notably, acute high-intensity aerobic exercise significantly increases ROS production and lipid peroxidation in obese people compared with non-obese individuals.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R108\" ref-type=\"bibr\">108</xref>]</sup> However, modest exercise can diminish systemic oxidative stress in T2DM, as low-intensity activities like walking reduce lipid peroxidation.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R109\" ref-type=\"bibr\">109</xref>]</sup> One possible mechanism is that moderate exercise-derived ROS promote hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation, while excessive exercise promotes oxidative damage and inactivation of AMPK.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R86\" ref-type=\"bibr\">86</xref>]</sup> These results suggest that low-intensity exercise might be preferable to improve redox homeostasis and insulin signaling in diabetes.</p>\\n        <p>A combination of an antioxidant-rich diet and physical activity significantly reduces the T2DM risk in both the general population and high-risk groups.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]</sup> Patients with diabetes have been found to significantly benefit from dietary antioxidants, like polyphenols, polysaccharides, vitamin C, or isoflavonoids.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R110\" ref-type=\"bibr\">110</xref>]</sup> Diets high in polyphenols, like herbal teas, coffee, olive oil, red wine, and grape seed, can manage and prevent T2DM.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R111\" ref-type=\"bibr\">111</xref>]</sup> These foods high in antioxidants are good resources for patients with diabetes and prediabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R81\" ref-type=\"bibr\">81</xref>]</sup> Some diets, such as those high in sugar as well as trans and saturated fats, will promote the generation of free radicals and accelerate the development of T2DM; therefore, they are not recommended for individuals with diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]</sup> Therefore, although more research is required to understand how diabetes alters the bioavailability and bioactivity of dietary antioxidants and free radicals, a healthy lifestyle with a specific diet and physical activity may provide an effective way to prevent or alleviate diabetes and its complications.</p>\\n      </sec>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec sec-type=\"conclusions\">\\n      <title>Conclusions and Perspectives</title>\\n      <p>In conclusion, diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder with numerous etiologies that is characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from insulin deficiency and resistance. Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in those with diabetes cause oxidative stress through a combination of increased ROS generation and an impaired antioxidant defense system. Oxidative stress, in turn, accelerates the progression of diabetes and its complications by impairing pancreatic beta cell function, increasing systemic insulin resistance, and initiating inflammation. Therefore, antioxidant therapies and lifestyle modifications like physical activity and a balanced diet have shown great potential in mitigating oxidative stress, providing precision medicine for preventing diabetes and its complications.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R112\" ref-type=\"bibr\">112</xref>]</sup> Antioxidants, including NAC, vitamin E, vitamin C, and melatonin, are currently used to treat diabetes in clinical trials [Supplementary Table 1, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://links.lww.com/CM9/C89\" ext-link-type=\"uri\">http://links.lww.com/CM9/C89</ext-link>]. However, several issues need to be resolved before the successful clinical application of antioxidant strategies in those with diabetes mellitus. First, there are differences in the extent to which oxidative stress contributes to various stages of diabetes and specific types of diabetes, which limits the efficacy of antioxidant approaches in facilitating rather than controlling diseases. Second, compounds may only have a limited antioxidant effect due to their negligible scavenging effect or the various types of cellular free radicals. For example, since all molecules react with &#xB7;OH at nearly the same rate, supplementing a &#xB7;OH scavenger for antioxidant defense is useless. Finally, small molecules have trouble in reaching sufficient antioxidant efficacy <italic toggle=\"yes\">in vivo</italic>, prompting additional dosage and administration time adjustments to become the most effective in clinical settings. To overcome these limitations, more investigations are required to understand how oxidative stress affects the progression of diabetes, to identify more effective antioxidants, and to explore the appropriate doses required for different stages of diabetes.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec>\\n      <title>Acknowledgments</title>\\n      <p>BioRender was used to create the figures.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec>\\n      <title>Funding</title>\\n      <p>This work was supported by grants from the National Key R&amp;D Program of China (Nos. 2023YFC3402100 and 2020YFA0509400), the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (No. 2019B030302012), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81821002, 82130082, 82341004, 82170844, and 82270613), the 1&#xB7;3&#xB7;5 project for disciplines of excellence, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (No. ZYGD22007 and ZYJC21004), and the Science and Technology Support Program of Sichuan Province (Nos. 2023NSFSC1878, 2021YFG0137, 2022YFH0045, and 2022YFH0102).</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec sec-type=\"COI-statement\">\\n      <title>Conflicts of interest</title>\\n      <p>None.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec sec-type=\"supplementary-material\">\\n      <title>Supplementary Material</title>\\n      <fig id=\"s001\" position=\"anchor\">\\n        <media xlink:href=\"cm9-138-015-s001.pdf\"/>\\n      </fig>\\n    </sec>\\n  </body>\\n  <back>\\n    <fn-group>\\n      <fn fn-type=\"equal\" id=\"fna1\">\\n        <p>Xingyu Chen and Na Xie contributed equally to this work.</p>\\n      </fn>\\n      <fn fn-type=\"other\">\\n        <p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Chen XY, Xie N, Feng LX, Huang YJ, Wu YY, Zhu HL, Tang J, Zhang YY.

In this study, we hypothesized that the FGF23 level increases with liver injury, which in turn induces liver fibrosis and osteodystrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Liver fibrosis model mice were generated via carbon tetrachloride administration and bile duct ligation.

RNA sequencing analysis of FGF23-treated LX-2 showed that FGF23 promotes the production of matrisome, which helps in forming the extracellular matrix. The FGF receptor antagonist pemigatinib alleviated carbon tetrachloride&#x2013;induced and bile duct ligation&#x2013;induced liver fibrosis and the deleterious alterations in bone density and microstructure in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The serum FGF23 level increased with liver injury, and FGF23 promoted liver fibrosis.

In both models, H&amp;E staining revealed disruption of the liver structure, and Masson trichrome staining showed collagen deposition (Figure <xref rid=\"F1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>A). In the CCl<sub>4</sub> model mice, the hydroxyproline assay showed a time-dependent increase in the collagen content of the liver (Figure <xref rid=\"F1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>B). FGF23 levels showed a time-dependent increase in the CCl<sub>4</sub> model mice, with a significant elevation observed after 8 weeks of treatment compared to that in the control mice (Figure <xref rid=\"F1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>C).

Therefore, we examined the effects of FGF23 on LX-2 cells, a human HSC line. We initially confirmed that FGFR1, FGFR3, FGFR4, but not Klotho, are expressed in LX-2 (Figure <xref rid=\"F2\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>A, Supplemental Figure S3, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://links.lww.com/HC9/B850\" ext-link-type=\"uri\">http://links.lww.com/HC9/B850</ext-link>). Subsequently, we conducted RNA sequencing using FGF23-treated LX-2 cells. Our results revealed that FGF23 treatment significantly altered the expression of 1658 genes (Figure <xref rid=\"F2\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>B). To further clarify the effects of FGF23 on LX-2 cells, we conducted Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using the Metascape and DAVID software. Notably, the Metascape analysis highlighted a significant upregulation in the expression of gene sets related to matrisome, including NABA Core Matrisome, NABA Matrisome Associated, NABA ECM Glycoproteins, and NABA Secreted Factors, which contribute to ECM formation (Figure <xref rid=\"F2\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>C). Matrisome is a novel concept that expands the definition of ECM to include not just fibrillar proteins but also nonfibrillar proteins involved in structural affiliations and growth factor expression regulation within the ECM. This broadened perspective extends beyond the traditional understanding of ECM composition.<xref rid=\"R35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">\\n<sup>35</sup></xref> Consistent with the results of analysis using Metascape, the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using DAVID revealed significant alterations in the expression of genes associated with the extracellular region in LX-2 cells following FGF23 treatment (Figure <xref rid=\"F2\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>D). Additionally, treating LX-2 cells with FGF23 at 1&#xA0;ng/mL, a concentration comparable to serum levels observed in mice with liver injury (as shown in Figure <xref rid=\"F1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>C, F), increased the mRNA expression of matrisome-related genes such as <italic toggle=\"yes\">COL4A3</italic>, <italic toggle=\"yes\">COL8A2</italic>, and <italic toggle=\"yes\">ADAM28</italic>, which are associated with liver fibrosis,<xref rid=\"R36\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>36</sup></xref><sup>&#x2013;</sup><xref rid=\"R38\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>38</sup></xref> consistent with the RNA sequencing results (Figure <xref rid=\"F2\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>E).

To test this hypothesis, we used pemigatinib, a pcan-FGFR inhibitor, to block the effects of FGF23 and assess its effect on liver fibrosis. The assessment of liver fibrosis involved measuring collagen levels using Masson trichrome staining hydroxyproline assay, and blood tests. Masson trichrome staining revealed a significant increase in the collagen-producing area in the CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrosis model, which was effectively suppressed by pemigatinib treatment (Figure <xref rid=\"F3\" ref-type=\"fig\">3</xref>A, B). The hydroxyproline assay also demonstrated a conspicuous increase in the collagen levels in the livers of mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub>, with pemigatinib significantly attenuating this increase (Figure <xref rid=\"F3\" ref-type=\"fig\">3</xref>C). Moreover, the liver function blood tests showed a marked elevation in ALT and AST levels in the liver fibrosis model, and pemigatinib treatment led to a reduction in their levels (Figure <xref rid=\"F3\" ref-type=\"fig\">3</xref>D, E). No significant differences were observed in the FGF23 levels between CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated and CCl<sub>4</sub>+pemigatinib-treated mice (Supplemental Figure S4, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://links.lww.com/HC9/B850\" ext-link-type=\"uri\">http://links.lww.com/HC9/B850</ext-link>), indicating that pemigatinib does not have any effects on the FGF23 production in the CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrosis model mice but suppresses the fibrosis observed in the liver by inhibiting the function exerted by FGF23. Furthermore, in the BDL-induced liver fibrosis model mice, pemigatinib treatment significantly reduced collagen deposition in the liver, as indicated by the hydroxyproline assay (Figure <xref rid=\"F3\" ref-type=\"fig\">3</xref>F, G). In vitro experiments using LX-2 also showed that the mRNA expressions of matrisome-related genes, such as <italic toggle=\"yes\">COL4A3</italic>, <italic toggle=\"yes\">COL8A2</italic>, and <italic toggle=\"yes\">ADAM28</italic>, which increase due to FGF23, were significantly suppressed to control levels by pemigatinib (Figure <xref rid=\"F3\" ref-type=\"fig\">3</xref>H).

Through DXA analysis, we observed a decrease in bone density in the liver fibrosis mouse model (Figure <xref rid=\"F4\" ref-type=\"fig\">4</xref>A). Examination of two-dimensional and three-dimensional photographs of the proximal femur revealed evident alterations in the trabecular bone microstructure in the liver fibrosis mouse model (Figure <xref rid=\"F4\" ref-type=\"fig\">4</xref>B, C). Furthermore, consistent with the DXA findings, the bone volume fraction, a reliable indicator of bone density, and bone volume were significantly decreased in the liver fibrosis mouse model compared with those in the control mice (Figure <xref rid=\"F4\" ref-type=\"fig\">4</xref>D, E). Additionally, key trabecular bone microstructure parameters such as thickness, separation, and number, which play crucial roles in determining bone quality, were evidently impaired in the liver fibrosis mouse model (Figure <xref rid=\"F4\" ref-type=\"fig\">4</xref>F&#x2013;H). However, cortical bone microstructure was unaffected by liver fibrosis (Figure <xref rid=\"F4\" ref-type=\"fig\">4</xref>I).

Therefore, we investigated whether pemigatinib could ameliorate liver fibrosis-induced bone damage. The DXA analysis revealed a significant reduction in bone density in mice with liver fibrosis compared with that in control mice, and this reduction was attenuated by pemigatinib treatment (Figure <xref rid=\"F5\" ref-type=\"fig\">5</xref>A). Furthermore, two-dimensional and three-dimensional micro-CT images revealed that pemigatinib tended to mitigate the bone structural damage induced by liver fibrosis (Figure <xref rid=\"F5\" ref-type=\"fig\">5</xref>B, C). The micro-CT analysis confirmed that all indexes of trabecular bone microstructure were markedly deteriorated in the liver fibrosis model mice compared with those in the control mice, and pemigatinib treatment exhibited a trend toward preserving these parameters (Figure <xref rid=\"F5\" ref-type=\"fig\">5</xref>D&#x2013;H). In contrast, the cortical bone microstructure remained unaffected by CCl<sub>4</sub> or pemigatinib treatment, consistent with our previous findings (Figures <xref rid=\"F5\" ref-type=\"fig\">5</xref>I, <xref rid=\"F4\" ref-type=\"fig\">4</xref>I). Finally, we assessed serum phosphorus and calcium levels to elucidate phosphorus dynamics in liver fibrosis. We observed a decrease in the serum phosphorus level in the liver fibrosis model mice, and it was restored to a level similar to that of the untreated group, with no alterations in the calcium level (Figure <xref rid=\"F5\" ref-type=\"fig\">5</xref>J, K).

Additionally, the exceptional characteristic of pemigatinib lies in its capacity to alleviate not only liver fibrosis but also subsequent osteodystrophy, setting it apart from other drugs and indicating its potential for broader application. Furthermore, we identified FGF23-mediated crosstalk between the liver and bone (Figure <xref rid=\"F6\" ref-type=\"fig\">6</xref>). Currently, effective therapeutic options for liver fibrosis are limited. The recent approval of resmetirom for the treatment of metabolic-associated steatohepatitis represents progress, but its efficacy is mainly limited to later stages of metabolic-associated steatohepatitis, leaving an unmet need for additional therapeutic targets.<xref rid=\"R39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">\\n<sup>39</sup></xref> Our study suggests that targeting FGF23-FGFR signaling is a promising new approach for treating liver fibrosis.</p>\\n      <fig position=\"float\" id=\"F6\">\\n        <label>FIGURE 6</label>\\n        <caption>\\n          <p>FGF23-mediated cross talk between the liver and bone.</p>\\n        </caption>\\n        <graphic xlink:href=\"hc9-9-e0610-g006\" position=\"float\"/>\\n      </fig>\\n      <p>In addition to liver-specific outcomes, such as cirrhosis and HCC, liver fibrosis is also associated with complications in other organs, including osteodystrophy and cardiac hypertrophy.<xref rid=\"R2\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=\"R3\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=\"R40\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=\"R41\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>41</sup></xref> While significant efforts have focused on liver-specific pathology, the mechanisms linking liver fibrosis to complications in other organs remain poorly understood. Given the lack of a definitive cure for liver fibrosis, effective management requires addressing both the primary condition and its systemic complications. Our findings indicate that pemigatinib not only suppresses liver fibrosis but also prevents fibrosis-related osteodystrophy, suggesting a comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Pemigatinib is widely used for treating FGFR2 fusion gene-positive unresectable biliary tract cancer and FGFR1 fusion gene-positive myeloid or lymphoid tumors, with approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.<xref rid=\"R42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">\\n<sup>42</sup></xref> Another potential therapeutic approach could involve directly targeting FGF23 itself, rather than FGFR. Burosumab, a neutralizing antibody against FGF23, is currently approved for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalacia.<xref rid=\"R43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">\\n<sup>43</sup></xref> Our findings suggest that these treatments, pemigatinib and burosumab, may be expanded to address liver fibrosis and its complications, such as osteodystrophy.</p>\\n      <p>Previous studies have suggested the profibrotic effects of FGF23 in the heart.<xref rid=\"R24\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>&#x2013;</sup><xref rid=\"R26\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>26</sup></xref> However, our study is the first to demonstrate its involvement in liver fibrosis through matrisome production. Although the importance of matrisome in liver fibrosis has been reported,<xref rid=\"R44\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>44</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=\"R45\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>45</sup></xref> relevant information is scarce. Our findings shed light on one of the mechanisms through which HSCs produce matrisome. Further molecular biology investigations into the fibrotic signals induced by FGF23 will improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fibrosis regulation in the liver.</p>\\n      <p>The prevailing theory regarding the mechanism of hepatic osteodystrophy is the deficiency of vitamin D and its metabolites,<xref rid=\"R6\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=\"R7\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>7</sup></xref> which inhibits calcium absorption in the intestinal tract and disrupts bone mineralization.<xref rid=\"R9\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=\"R10\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=\"R12\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>12</sup></xref> Herein, we propose a novel mechanism for the pathogenesis of osteodystrophy induced by FGF23 production during liver injury. Additionally, as shown in Figure <xref rid=\"F5\" ref-type=\"fig\">5</xref>J and K, the serum phosphorus level decreased with liver injury, whereas the calcium level remained unchanged. Given that the inhibition of FGFR restored the serum phosphorus level and bone structure, maintaining adequate phosphorus level may also be crucial in the treatment of osteodystrophy resulting from liver injury. Another group has reported a decrease in osteoprogenitor cells and an increase in bone repair inhibitor proteins in cirrhosis.<xref rid=\"R46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">\\n<sup>46</sup></xref> It is possible that the elevated levels of FGF23 observed in our study may be contributing to these phenomena. Furthermore, our preliminary in vivo experiments showed an age-related increase in the serum FGF23 level (Supplemental Figure S5, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://links.lww.com/HC9/B850\" ext-link-type=\"uri\">http://links.lww.com/HC9/B850</ext-link>). Given the detrimental effects of increased FGF23 levels on bone microstructure, it is plausible that FGF23 may contribute to age-related bone diseases and could serve as a potential target for preventing or treating such conditions.</p>\\n      <p>The following 2 main pathways through which FGF23 exerts its effects are known: the Klotho-dependent pathway mediated by FGFR1 and &#x3B1;-Klotho, and the Klotho-independent pathway mediated solely by FGFR3 and FGFR4. As shown in Figure <xref rid=\"F2\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>A, we observed FGFR1 expression but not Klotho expression in human HSC cell lines, making it unlikely that FGF23 exerted its effect on HSCs through a Klotho-dependent pathway. As excess FGF23 has been shown to exert its effects in a Klotho-independent manner via FGFR3 and FGFR4, it could promote matrisome production in HSCs through this pathway, thus promoting liver fibrosis. Future studies employing pharmacological or genetic inhibition of FGFR3 or FGFR4 expression could elucidate these possibilities in more detail.</p>\\n      <p>Complications from liver fibrosis include not only osteodystrophy but also cardiomyopathy.<xref rid=\"R40\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=\"R41\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>41</sup></xref> Previous studies have suggested that the primary causes of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy are cardiotoxic factors in the serum, such as TNF-&#x3B1;, which is produced in the fibrotic liver.<xref rid=\"R47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">\\n<sup>47</sup></xref> As FGF23-FGFR4 signaling has been implicated in the development of cardiomyopathy,<xref rid=\"R48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">\\n<sup>48</sup></xref> elevated FGF23 levels due to liver fibrosis may also affect the heart via FGFR4 signaling, potentially leading to cardiomyopathy. Consequently, FGF23 emerges as a major factor in the crosstalk between the liver and heart, providing insights into the pathogenesis of various complications associated with liver fibrosis.</p>\\n      <p>This study has 2 notable limitations. First, the mechanism through which liver fibrosis promotes excessive FGF23 production remains unclear. Although the PCR analysis of <italic toggle=\"yes\">Fgf23</italic> mRNA expression in the bone revealed that bone is the primary source of FGF23 (Figure <xref rid=\"F1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>H), the factors originating from the liver that stimulate FGF23 production in the bone need further investigation. Our previous research has demonstrated that liver-derived TNF-&#x3B1; can affect skeletal muscle during liver fibrosis via the bloodstream, leading to muscle atrophy.<xref rid=\"R49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">\\n<sup>49</sup></xref> Additionally, liver damage can result in the release of extracellular vesicles that circulate systemically.<xref rid=\"R50\" ref-type=\"bibr\">\\n<sup>50</sup></xref> These findings suggest that liver-derived humoral factors, such as TNF-&#x3B1;, extracellular vesicles, or other molecules, might influence the bone microenvironment and promote FGF23 production.</p>\\n      <p>Second, as we used an FGFR antagonist rather than FGF23-neutralizing antibodies, we could not directly demonstrate the effect of FGF23 on liver fibrosis and osteodystrophy in vivo. Future investigations employing FGF23-neutralizing antibodies could overcome this limitation and advance our understanding of FGF23-mediated liver-bone communication.</p>\\n      <p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated a correlation between liver fibrosis and increased serum FGF23 level, reduced bone density, and compromised bone microstructure, all of which were mitigated by pemigatinib. These findings contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis-related complications, including hepatic osteodystrophy, and provide insights into the development of potential therapeutic interventions targeting these complications.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n    <sec sec-type=\"supplementary-material\">\\n      <title>Supplementary Material</title>\\n      <fig id=\"s001\" position=\"anchor\">\\n        <media xlink:href=\"hc9-9-e0610-s001.docx\"/>\\n      </fig>\\n    </sec>\\n  </body>\\n  <back>\\n    <ack>\\n      <title>DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT</title>\\n      <p>All data except the RNA sequencing data are included in the manuscript and supporting information.

ILD can arise from numerous causes, including connective tissue diseases (CTDs) such as systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), Sj&#xF6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome (SS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with SSc, RA, and IIM being more prevalent. The reported prevalence of ILD varies widely across studies owing to differences in inclusion criteria, research methodologies, and follow-up durations. For instance, the prevalence of ILD in SSc can reach 30%, with a 10-year mortality rate of up to 40%.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>]</sup> The exact prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) remains uncertain, ranging from 1% to 58% based on different study methodologies.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]</sup> The global prevalence of ILD in polymyositis and dermatomyositis (PM/DM) is approximately 41%, with a higher prevalence in Asian populations.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>]</sup> ILD profoundly affects the treatment approaches, quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in patients with rheumatic diseases. The overlapping pathological and clinical features of ILDs complicate diagnosis and pose significant challenges in the management of CTD-ILDs.</p>\\n    <p><bold>Overview of pathogenesis in CTD-ILD:</bold> ILD has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CTDs. The pathogenesis of ILD primarily involves inflammation and damage to the alveolar epithelium, leading to the activation of pulmonary interstitial fibroblasts. Activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts produce excessive extracellular matrix proteins that contribute to scar formation in the lungs. Interactions among various cell types can influence the patterns and severity of fibrosis. Autoantibodies, as well as components of both innate and adaptive immunity, are crucial in regulating CTD-ILD progression [Figure <xref rid=\"F1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>].<sup>[<xref rid=\"R4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]</sup></p>\\n    <fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\">\\n      <label>Figure 1</label>\\n      <caption>\\n        <p>Pathogenesis of RA-ILD, MDA5+ DM-ILD, and SSc-ILD and the associated JAK-STAT pathway. Under the influence of various factors, AT II differentiates into lung myofibroblasts through the EMT process, while lung fibroblasts differentiate into lung myofibroblasts via the FMT process. This differentiation results in ECM secretion, which contributes to the development of ILD. TGF-&#x3B2;1, through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, can induce EMT, whereas IL-6 and TGF-&#x3B2;1, via the JAK/STAT pathway, can induce FMT. In the pathogenesis of RA-ILD, the presence of plasma cells secreting anti-CCP antibodies or producing RF in RA patients stimulates NETs. This, in turn, induces lung fibroblasts to differentiate into lung myofibroblasts via FMT. In the pathogenesis of MDA5+ DM-ILD, pDCs and mDCs produce IFN-&#x3B2;. IFN-&#x3B2; activates monocytes and macrophages, leading to the production of additional mDCs and increased IFN-&#x3B2; expression. IFN-&#x3B2; can induce ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in DM, with ROS subsequently activating TGF-&#x3B2;1, thereby contributing to ILD development. In the pathogenesis of SSc-ILD, autoimmune and inflammatory responses, along with pathogens and environmental factors, may induce endothelial and epithelial injury, activate the immune system, recruit fibroblasts, and lead to the phenotypic transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts.

Currently, five JAKi (tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, filgotinib, and peficitinib) are approved for clinical use in RA. Evidence indicates that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia. This pathway is activated by profibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, and IL-13, which are upregulated in various ILDs. Additionally, certain growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor &#x3B2;1 (TGF-&#x3B2;1), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), are overexpressed in ILD and can activate the JAK/STAT pathway through typical or atypical pathways. These observations suggest a pivotal role of JAK/STAT signaling in ILD. Nevertheless, further research is needed to fully elucidate the involvement of the JAK/STAT pathway in these diseases [Figure <xref rid=\"F1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>].<sup>[<xref rid=\"R5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid=\"R7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]</sup></p>\\n    <p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) combined with immunosuppressive therapy can be used to treat certain CTD-ILD cases. However, traditional treatments are often ineffective for refractory, rapidly progressing-ILD (RPILD), and relapsed ILD. JAKi offer a novel therapeutic option for CTD-ILD. Among these, tofacitinib (a JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor) and baricitinib (a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor) are currently the most extensively used drugs for the management of rheumatic diseases.</p>\\n    <p><bold>Efficacy of JAKi in RA-ILD:</bold> RA is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by persistent symmetrical erosive synovitis. It may also present with extra-articular manifestations, one of the most common of which is ILD, a significant contributor to the high mortality of patients with RA.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>]</sup></p>\\n    <p>The current treatment options differ. Tofacitinib, the first JAKi approved for the treatment of RA, has an uncertain effect on RA-ILD. Nevertheless, phase II and III clinical trials for RA have demonstrated its efficacy and safety. It has a short half-life and a rapid onset of action. It has been shown to mitigate the progression of zymosan-induced ILD in SKG mice. Compared with the controls, tofacitinib significantly inhibited ILD progression by expanding myeloid-derived suppressor cells and suppressing the proliferation and differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells. These findings suggest possible therapeutic benefits of tofacitinib in RA-ILD.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>]</sup></p>\\n    <p>In a cohort study involving 28,559 patients with RA, treatment with tofacitinib was associated with a 4% reduction in the incidence of ILD compared with all classes of biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Additionally, tofacitinib is associated with a reduced risk of ILD in patients with RA.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]</sup> A retrospective analysis of 43 patients with RA-ILD treated with JAKi suggested that JAKi may be a safe short-term treatment option that stabilizes high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]</sup> Another study assessed pulmonary function before and after tofacitinib treatment in 18 patients with RA-ILD. After one year, the percentage of forced vital capacity increased by 3.0% from baseline, whereas the percentage of forced expiratory volume in one second remained stable. These results suggest that pulmonary function in patients with RA-ILD treated with tofacitinib could remain relatively stable over a one-year period, supporting the potential efficacy of JAKi for RA-ILD.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>]</sup> However, a study involving 36 patients with RA treated with JAKi demonstrated a 5.6% deterioration rate in ILD imaging and an 18.2% deterioration rate in those with pre-existing ILD. Notably, no new cases of ILD were reported, suggesting that JAKi may be a viable treatment option for patients with RA.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>]</sup></p>\\n    <p><bold>Efficacy of JAKi in dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease (DM-ILD):</bold> ILD is the most common pulmonary manifestation of IIM and can occur at any stage of the disease with high morbidity and mortality rates.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]</sup> Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibodies are associated with dermatomyositis (DM) and are considered risk factors for acute or subacute interstitial pneumonia.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>]</sup> RPILD is the strongest independent predictor of mortality in patients with IIM-ILD. The current standard treatment for RPILD associated with anti-MDA5-positive DM includes high-dose GCs in combination with calcineurin inhibitors with or without cyclophosphamide. When combined immunosuppressive therapies are ineffective against IIM-ILD, JAKi are an alternative treatment option.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>]</sup></p>\\n    <p>In 2018, Kurasawa <italic toggle=\"yes\">et al</italic><sup>[<xref rid=\"R17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that tofacitinib was effective in treating refractory RPILD associated with anti-MDA5 antibody-positive DM. In 2019, Chen <italic toggle=\"yes\">et al</italic><sup>[<xref rid=\"R18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>]</sup> conducted a single-center prospective clinical study to assess the efficacy of tofacitinib in patients with early anti-MDA5 antibody-positive amyopathic dermatomyositis-ILD (ADM-ILD). Their results indicated that, following ILD onset, the 6-month survival rate in the prospective group (18/18, 100%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (25/32, 78%), suggesting that early intervention with JAKi is critical for the treatment of ADM-ILD before severe pulmonary function deterioration occurs. Furthermore, related case reports have supported the therapeutic efficacy of tofacitinib in IIM-ILD, with dose escalation demonstrating its effectiveness. A case series study has suggested that combination therapy with methylprednisolone, rituximab, and tofacitinib may exhibit therapeutic efficacy in the early treatment of RPILD associated with anti-MDA5 antibody-positive DM. However, further validation of its safety and efficacy is needed.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]</sup> Considering these findings, a larger prospective study is required to confirm these results.</p>\\n    <p><bold>Efficacy of JAKi in systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD):</bold> SSc is a rheumatic disease characterized by vasculopathy, inflammation, and extensive fibrosis affecting multiple organs. It is often complicated by ILD, which is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Current treatments for SSc-ILD include cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, anti-IL-6 agents (tocilizumab), anti-B-cell therapies (rituximab), and antifibrotic drugs (nintedanib). JAKi were demonstrated to impede the fibrosis pathway in a mouse model of SSc by interfering with the TGF-&#x3B2;1-mediated JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Currently, JAKi are used in conjunction with GCs and other immunosuppressants to mitigate inflammation and manage severe rheumatic conditions.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]</sup></p>\\n    <p>In a study involving nine patients treated with tofacitinib for &#x2265;6 months, significant improvements were observed in diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), reduction of ground-glass opacities and pleural thickening on HRCT, and decreased pulmonary fibrosis scores compared with 35 patients receiving conventional therapy. This suggests that tofacitinib enhances sclerosis and addresses early radiological abnormalities in SSc-ILD.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>]</sup> Given the dual effects of JAKi on both inflammatory and fibrotic components of the disease, early treatment with JAKi before the onset of fibrosis may lead to improved outcomes. However, larger cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to validate these preliminary findings.</p>\\n    <p><bold>Safety of JAKi in CTD-ILD:</bold> JAKi are new small-molecule agents of varying types, but their safety profiles generally overlap. Common adverse effects include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, headaches, and diarrhea, with a notable incidence of viral infections, such as herpes zoster. Studies indicate that JAKi elevate the risk of non-opportunistic respiratory tract infections (including upper and lower respiratory infections, influenza, and pneumonia) compared with placebo, whereas opportunistic respiratory infections, ILD, venous thromboembolism, and lung neoplasms are rare. Tofacitinib, which is metabolized and excreted by the liver and kidneys, may lead to adverse events in patients with severe liver or renal impairment, necessitating dose reduction.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]</sup> An interim report from Japan&#x2019;s post-marketing surveillance program highlighted infection as the most frequent adverse event, with serious infections, including herpes zoster and pneumonia/bacterial pneumonia.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]</sup></p>\\n    <p>Patients with RA treated with JAKi have a lower risk of developing ILD.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>]</sup> Another study comparing the safety of JAKi and rituximab for RA-ILD found that JAKi treatment did not increase the risk of hospitalization or mortality due to respiratory causes compared with rituximab. Therefore, JAKi may be a safe treatment option for patients with RA-ILD.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>]</sup> In a retrospective study, patients with RA-ILD treated with tofacitinib showed a higher incidence of severe infections requiring drug discontinuation, especially lower respiratory tract infections, than patients with RA without ILD who were also treated with tofacitinib.<sup>[<xref rid=\"R12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>]</sup> In conclusion, whether JAKi increase the risk of infections in patients with CTD-ILD and their safety in other CTD-ILDs (such as SSc-ILD and DM-ILD) requires further validation through large-scale clinical studies.</p>\\n    <p><bold>Summary and prospects:</bold> JAKi have certain disadvantages, including an increased risk of infections, particularly viral diseases such as herpes zoster, and a risk of developing new ILD, although the incidence remains low. Furthermore, JAKi are less selective than biological agents, as they can inhibit cytokine signaling pathways, and their targeting specificity is not absolute. Despite these limitations, JAKi have been used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as RA. Some studies have confirmed their effectiveness in managing CTD-ILD. JAKi are considered particularly effective when the conventional triple therapy (high-dose GCs, cyclophosphamide, and calcineurin inhibitors) is ineffective against CTD-ILD. These represent a viable treatment option for CTD-ILD and introduce a new therapeutic strategy for rheumatic diseases.</p>\\n    <p>Currently, research on the use of JAKi in the treatment of CTD-ILD is limited. This review focused on the safety and efficacy of JAKi in RA-ILD, DM-ILD, and SSc-ILD. Further studies are needed to explore the potential applications of JAKi in other CTD-ILDs, such as SLE-ILD and SS-ILD. Ongoing and recently concluded clinical trials are investigating the use of JAKi for the treatment of CTD-ILD (ChiCTR2100047938, ChiCTR2000031389, NCT04311567, NCT05177471, and NCT05246293). The results of these studies may provide valuable insights for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of CTD-ILDs in the future; however, large-scale RCTs are necessary to thoroughly evaluate their efficacy and safety.</p>\\n    <sec sec-type=\"COI-statement\">\\n      <title>Conflicts of interest</title>\\n      <p>None.</p>\\n    </sec>\\n  </body>\\n  <back>\\n    <fn-group>\\n      <fn fn-type=\"equal\" id=\"fna1\">\\n        <p>Jiajia Wu, Chunli Mei, and Zhijun Luo contributed equally to this work.</p>\\n      </fn>\\n      <fn fn-type=\"other\">\\n        <p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Wu JJ, Mei CL, Luo ZJ, Yuan XJ, Lin WX, Du R.
